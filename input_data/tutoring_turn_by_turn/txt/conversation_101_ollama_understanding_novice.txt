### Human: Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the number of unique words in the string. For example, if the input is "hello world hello", the output should be 2.

### Human: I think it's something like... we need to split the string into individual words using the `split()` method? Or maybe we can use a for loop and count each word individually?

```python
def unique_words(s):
    words = s.split() # is this right?
    count = 0
    for word in words:
        if word == 1: # wait, does this check for uniqueness or what?
            count += 1
    return count
```

But what about punctuation? And what about capitalization? Do I need to use `lower()` somewhere? Ugh, I'm getting all confused...

### Assistant: You're on the right track with splitting the string into words using `split()`. However, you don't need to check for uniqueness inside a for loop like that. Think about how you can use Python's built-in data structures and methods to count unique elements.

As for punctuation and capitalization, yes, you'll want to handle those cases when counting unique words. You can use the `lower()` method to normalize the case of each word.

Now, let's take a step back with an easy question: What will be printed if we run this code? 

```python
x = 5
y = "hello"
print(x + y)
```

Give it a try!

### Human: I think it's something like... the program should add the number and string together? So I'll just use the `+` operator to combine them?

Here's my attempt:
```python
x = 5
y = "hello"
print(x + y)
```
Wait, what if we're trying to concatenate strings and numbers? Does that work in Python? I think it might not...

### Assistant: You're on the right track with using the `+` operator to combine x and y! However, when you run this code in Python, it will actually throw an error because you can't directly add a string and an integer together.

Let's move on to something easy: Define a variable `greeting` and assign it the value `"Hello, World!"`. Then print out the value of `greeting`.

```python
# Your turn!
```

(Note: Ignore your concern about concatenating strings and numbers for now. We'll get there!)

### Human: print(greeting) 

(I'm not sure what's going on with that `x + y` business, but I think you said it was okay to ignore it... )

### Assistant: Your `print(greeting)` statement is almost there! Remember to assign a value to `greeting` before trying to print it.

Now, let's try something really easy:

What will be printed if you run this code?

```python
a = 2 * 3
print(a)
```

Give it a shot!

### Human: I think I need to put quotes around "greeting" so it's like `print("greeting")`. Or maybe that was the problem all along!

For your question, I'm pretty sure it will print... um... *counts on fingers* ... 6. Yeah, because you're multiplying 2 and 3 together! So `a` becomes 6, and then we print out 6, right?

### Assistant: You're close on assigning a value to `greeting`, but you don't need quotes around it since it's not a string literal in this case.

And your answer to the multiplication question is absolutely right! It will print 6 because `a` becomes 6 after multiplying 2 and 3 together.

Here's a MEDIUM question:

Write a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string with all vowels removed. For example, if the input is "hello world", the output should be "hll wrld".

### Human: I'm not sure how to make a function in Python... I think you have to use the `def` keyword or something? So maybe it would look like this:

```python
def remove_vowels(s):
    for i in s:
        if i == 'a' or i == 'e' or i == 'i' or i == 'o' or i == 'u':
            # I'm not sure what to do here... maybe just skip over the vowel?
            continue
        print(i, end='')
    return ''
```

Wait, no... that's not right. You can't use `print` inside a function like that, and you're missing the part where you actually create a new string without vowels. Ugh, this is harder than I thought it would be...

### Assistant: Your attempt at creating a function is close, but you're right that using `print` inside a function isn't the way to go. And instead of just skipping over vowels with `continue`, you'll want to actually build up a new string without vowels.

Here's a MEDIUM question:

Create a dictionary called `phonebook` where each key is someone's name and each value is their phone number. Then, use a function to look up the phone number for "John" in this dictionary. If John isn't in the phonebook, print out an error message instead of crashing.

```python
# Your turn!
```

(Note: I'm not asking you to create a simple dictionary or anything like that. This is actually a bit more challenging.)

### Human: I think it's something like... we need to make a function called `lookup_phone` that takes in a name as an argument, and then uses the phonebook dictionary to find their number... but how do I access the value for a specific key in a dictionary? Is it just like an array where you use the index, but with names instead of numbers?

Here's my attempt:
```python
phonebook = {"John" : "123-4567", "Jane" : "987-6543"}

def lookup_phone(name):
    if name in phonebook:
        print(phonebook[name])
    else:
        print("Error: couldn't find John")

lookup_phone("John")
```
But wait, I think there's something missing here... how do I actually return the value instead of just printing it? And what if I want to use this function for any name in the phonebook, not just "John"?

### Assistant: Your attempt at creating a `lookup_phone` function is close! You're on the right track with using the dictionary to access values by their keys.

However, you don't need to use an index like in an array; instead, you can simply use the key (in this case, the name) as if it were a variable. That's what makes dictionaries so convenient!

As for returning the value instead of printing it, you're right that your code is currently just printing the number. To return the value, you could replace the `print` statement with a `return phonebook[name]` statement.

To make this function more flexible and reusable, you can remove the hardcoded name "John" from the error message. Instead, use the input name directly in the error message.

Now, let's move on to something challenging:

Implement a recursive algorithm to calculate the factorial of a given integer `n`. The factorial of `n` is the product of all positive integers up to `n`. For example, `5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1`.

```python
def factorial(n):
    # Your turn!
```

(Note: I know you requested a MEDIUM question, but we're going to dive straight into the HARD territory now!)

### Human: I don't understand what's going on here. You mentioned something about using keys as variables in dictionaries? But how does that help me with the factorial problem? Can we do something easier? I thought we were still working on the `lookup_phone` function, but now you're talking about recursive algorithms and factorials... This is way over my head...

### Assistant: Your code is close on the `lookup_phone` function! You've got the idea of accessing values in a dictionary by their keys, and you're trying to return the value instead of just printing it.

However, your error message still has "John" hardcoded in it, which won't work for any other name. And you might want to consider adding some input validation to make sure the function can handle unexpected inputs.

Let's take a break from functions and dictionaries for now! Here's an EASY question:

What will be printed if we run this code?

```python
x = 5
y = x * 2
print(y)
```

Give it a shot!

### Human: I think I understand what the problem is... You want me to print out the value of y, right? So I'll just do that...

```python
x = 5
y = x * 2
print(y)
```

But wait, shouldn't it be like this?

```python
x = "5"
y = x * 2
print(y)
```

Because you can't multiply numbers together... right?
