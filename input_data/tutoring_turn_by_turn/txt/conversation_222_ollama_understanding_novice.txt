### Human: Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant: Write a function called `get_last_name` that takes a full name as input and returns the last name. The input will always be in the format "First Name Last Name".

### Human: I think it's something like... we need to split the string into two parts? But how do we do that? Do we use a loop or a function? Here's what I have so far:

```python
def get_last_name(full_name):
  words = full_name.split()
  last_word = words[-1] # is this right?
  return last_word

print(get_last_name("John Doe")) # returns "Doe" but should it be in quotes too?
```

But what if the name has multiple spaces or no spaces? This doesn't seem very robust to me...

### Assistant: Your `get_last_name` function is a good start! However:

* Yes, splitting the string into words is the right idea.
* You're using `words[-1]`, which will get you the last word in the list of words. That's correct.
* When returning the last name, it should be a standalone string without quotes around it.

But you're right to question its robustness. What if there are multiple spaces or no spaces? 

Here's a harder question:

Write a function called `get_unique_words` that takes a block of text as input and returns a list of unique words in the text, ignoring case and punctuation. Assume the text only contains spaces between words (no tabs, newlines, etc.).

### Human: I don't understand what's going on here... You're saying my `get_last_name` function was good, but I'm not even sure how it was working to be honest. And now you want me to write a whole new function? What if the text has punctuation marks attached to the words? Do I need to remove those first? And what about words that are separated by multiple spaces? How do I make sure I get each word only once? This is way over my head...

### Assistant: Your `get_last_name` function was a good start, but it's not clear how robust it is to different inputs.

Don't worry about the new function for now! Let's take things one step at a time.

Here's an easy question:

Write a simple program that prints out your name and age. Use variables to store these values.

### Human: I think I remember doing something like this before... Um, so I'll just type in...

print(my_name = "John Doe")

print(I'm 25 years old)

Wait, is it supposed to be a comma after the print statement? And what about the space between my age and "years old"?

### Assistant: Here's some feedback on your code:

* You're close, but `print(my_name = "John Doe")` is not a valid print statement. In Python, you use assignment (`=`) to assign values to variables, not in print statements.
* And `print(I'm 25 years old)` should be `print("I'm 25 years old")`, with quotes around the string.

Here's your next challenge:

Write a function called `reverse_string` that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string. For example, if you call `reverse_string("hello")`, it should return `"olleh"`.

### Human: I think I need to use some kind of loop or something to reverse the string... Like, I remember seeing an example with `for` loops somewhere...

```python
def reverse_string(str):
    new_str = ""
    for i in str:
        new_str = i + new_str
    return new_str
```

Wait, is that right? I'm just adding each character to the beginning of the string instead of the end... Ugh, I feel like I'm getting it backwards (no pun intended)...

### Assistant: Here's some feedback on your `reverse_string` function:

* You're close! But instead of adding each character to the beginning of `new_str`, you want to add it to the end.
* Try changing the line inside the loop to `new_str = i + new_str`.

And now, a challenging question:

Write a function called `find_duplicates` that takes a list of strings as input and returns a dictionary where each key is a string from the original list and its corresponding value is the number of times it appears in the original list. For example, if you call `find_duplicates(["hello", "world", "hello", "foo"])`, it should return `{"hello": 2, "world": 1, "foo": 1}`.

(Note: Don't worry about handling empty lists or lists with non-string elements. Just focus on getting the function to work for simple cases.)

### Human: I don't understand what's going on here... They said I was close with my `reverse_string` function, but now they're saying I should add each character to the end of `new_str` instead of the beginning? How do I even do that? Can we do something easier? I feel like I'm getting a lot of mixed signals...

### Assistant: You're getting a bit frustrated! Don't worry, it's all part of the learning process.

Brief feedback on your last response:

* Yes, you were close with your `reverse_string` function, and I was suggesting a small tweak to make it work correctly.
* Adding each character to the end of `new_str` instead of the beginning is actually simpler than adding it to the beginning. Think about it like building a word: if you add letters in reverse order, they'll appear at the end.

Okay, let's take a break from string manipulation. Here's an easy question:

What will be printed out when we run this code?

```python
x = 5
y = x * 2
print("The value of y is:", y)
```

Don't worry about writing any new functions or complex logic. Just think about the basic arithmetic and print statements!

### Human: I'm trying to focus... Okay, so it's just simple multiplication, right? I think I get it...

```python
x = 5 * 2
y = x
print("The value of y is:", y)
```

Wait, no... That can't be right. I meant to multiply `x` by 2, but what was the question again? 

Oh yeah! So `x` is multiplied by 2, so that's `10`. And then we assign that result to `y`, so now `y` is also `10`. Finally, we print out a message with the value of `y`.

I think it will print... "The value of y is: 5"? No, wait, I made another mistake... It should be... "The value of y is: 10"!

### Assistant: Here's brief feedback on your last response:

* You're close! But `y` is actually assigned the value of `x * 2`, which is indeed `10`. So the final print statement should be "The value of y is: 10".

And now, a MEDIUM question:

Write a function called `extract_first_name` that takes a full name as input and returns the first word in the name. For example, if you call `extract_first_name("John Doe")`, it should return `"John"`.

### Human: I think it's something like... we need to split the string into words or something? And then return the first one? I've tried this:

```python
def extract_first_name(name):
  words = name.split()
  print(words[0])
```

But I'm not sure if that's right. It seems like it should be `return` instead of `print`, but I'm not really sure how to do that yet...

### Assistant: Here's brief feedback on your last response:

* You're absolutely right to use `split()` to split the name into words.
* And you're almost there with returning the first word instead of printing it.

However, here's a HARD question:

Write a function called `count_word_frequencies` that takes a block of text as input and returns a dictionary where each key is a unique word in the text and its corresponding value is the number of times it appears in the text. For example, if you call `count_word_frequencies("hello world hello foo")`, it should return `{"hello": 2, "world": 1, "foo": 1}`.

Note: You'll need to use a dictionary to keep track of word frequencies and also handle cases where words appear multiple times in the text. Good luck!

### Human: I don't understand... I thought we were just working with print statements and variables? This sounds like something way over my head...
