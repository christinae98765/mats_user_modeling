### Human: Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant: Write a recursive function to flatten a nested list in Python, where each inner list can contain any number of elements, including other lists. 

```python
nested_list = [1, 2, [3, 4, [5, 6]], 7, [8, 9]]
```

### Human: I don't understand how recursion works with nested lists... Like, I know it's supposed to be a function that calls itself until it gets to the end of something, but I'm not sure how you'd even start writing one for this. It seems like it would get really complicated, especially with all those different levels of nesting.

### Assistant: Don't worry about understanding recursion just yet - it's a concept that takes practice to get used to.

Since you didn't provide a code attempt, let's start from scratch. Try writing a simple recursive function in Python. Here's an example of what you could try:

Write a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given number (n).

### Human: I think it's something like... you call the function and then it calls itself? But how do I make it stop calling itself when it gets to the end?

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        n *= factorial(n-1)
    return n

I'm not really sure if this is right, but it looks like what you'd want to do, right? You start with a number and then keep multiplying it by the factorial of the number minus one until you get to zero... I hope.

### Assistant: You're on the right track! The recursive function is calling itself with decreasing values of `n` until it reaches 0.

However, there's a small issue in your implementation. You're returning `n` after the recursive call, but you shouldn't be doing that. Instead, just return the result of the recursive call directly. This will give you the factorial value without modifying the original input `n`.

Try again!

Now, here's an EASY question to get you warmed up: Write a Python program that asks for your name and then prints out "Hello, [your_name]!"

### Human: I'm still trying to wrap my head around recursion... I think it's something like:

def factorial(n):
  if n <= 1:
    return 5
  else:
    # ... umm...

Wait, what do I put here? Do I just copy and paste the whole function again with `n-1` instead of `n`?

Uh, let me think...

### Assistant: You're close on understanding recursion! 

Instead of copying and pasting the whole function, you should call the `factorial` function with `n-1` as an argument. Think about what happens when `n` is 2 - it will call itself with `n=1`. And what happens when it's called again? You're on the right track!

Here's a brief example to illustrate the idea: `return n * factorial(n-1)`

Now, let's try something challenging.

Write a recursive function that traverses a nested dictionary (a dictionary containing other dictionaries or lists as values) and returns all keys at depth 2. For example:

```python
nested_dict = {
    'key1': 'value1',
    'key2': {'subkey1': 'subvalue1', 'subkey2': {'subsubkey1': 'subsubvalue1'}},
    'key3': [1, 2, {'subkey3': 'subvalue3'}]
}
```

### Human: I don't understand how to write a recursive function that does this... I'm still trying to wrap my head around recursion in general. The example you gave me helps a bit, but it's like, what if there are multiple levels of nesting? And what about the lists - do we need to check those too? I feel like I'd get lost in all the parentheses and function calls... This is way over my head...

### Assistant: It's okay to feel overwhelmed - recursion can be tricky at first!

Brief feedback: You're trying to understand the concept of recursion, and that's a great start! It's normal to struggle with it at first. Let's break it down further.

Here's an easy question:

Write a Python program that prints "Hello!" 5 times, using a loop (for or while).

### Human: I think I have to use a for loop because we need to repeat something a certain number of times... Um, so it would be like this:

for x = 0; x < 5; x++:
print("Hello!")

Wait, no, that's not how you write a for loop in Python... Do I need quotes around "Hello!"? And what about the x part, is that necessary too?

Oh well, hopefully it looks close enough!

### Assistant: Brief feedback:

* You're on the right track with using a loop to repeat something 5 times.
* In Python, you need quotes around "Hello!" because it's a string (text).
* The `x` part in the for loop is necessary because it helps keep track of how many iterations have been done.

Now, here's a MEDIUM question:

Write a function that takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list with all strings converted to uppercase.

### Human: I think I understand what you mean by quotes around "Hello!"... But now this other thing is confusing me... Um, so we need to write a function... Right? So it's like a special block of code that does something...

Here's my attempt at writing the function:

```python
def convert_to_uppercase(list_of_strings):
    for x in range(5): # Wait, no! We don't need this loop!
        new_list = []
        for string in list_of_strings:
            new_list.append(string.upper())
    return new_list
```

I'm not sure if I got it right... It looks like I used a loop even though you said we didn't need one... And what's with the `x` part again? Do I really need to use that?

### Assistant: Brief feedback:

* You're close on understanding functions and converting strings to uppercase.
* You correctly used a loop (without an `x` part) to iterate over each string in the list.
* The `string.upper()` method is exactly what we need to convert each string to uppercase.

Now, here's a MEDIUM question:

Write a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string with all vowels removed. For example: `remove_vowels("hello world")` would return `"hll wrld"`.

### Human: I think it's something like we need to use the upper() method again, but this time to check if each character is a vowel... I mean, I think we can just remove all characters that are equal to "a", "e", "i", "o", or "u" from the string. Here's my attempt:

```python
def remove_vowels(s):
    for c in s:
        if (c == 'a') or (c == 'e') or (c == 'i') or (c == 'o') or (c == 'u'):
            return s.replace(c, '')
    return s

print(remove_vowels("hello world"))
```

But wait... I'm not sure about the for loop. Do we need to use a while loop instead? And what if there are no vowels in the string? Does it still work? Hmm...

### Assistant: Brief feedback:

* You're close on understanding how to remove vowels from a string.
* However, you used `s.replace(c, '')` which is not what we want - it replaces all occurrences of the vowel in the entire string, but we only need to remove that one character.
* Also, your loop condition should be outside the if statement because once we find a vowel, we want to skip the rest of the characters in the current iteration.

Try again!

Here's an EASY question (just for fun): Write a Python program that prints "Hello!" and then asks for your name.

### Human: I think I almost got it last time... Okay, let me try again...

```python
def remove_vowels(s):
    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
    new_s = ""
    for c in s:
        if c == 'a' or c == 'e':
            continue
        elif c == 'i' or c == 'o':
            continue
        elif c == 'u':
            continue
        new_s += c
    return new_s

s = "hello"
print(remove_vowels(s))
```

Wait, I think this is still wrong... Do I need to use a `for` loop for each vowel? And why isn't it working when there are multiple vowels in the string?

And now, let me try that EASY question you mentioned...

```python
print("Hello!")
name = input()
print(name)
```

I hope this is right!
