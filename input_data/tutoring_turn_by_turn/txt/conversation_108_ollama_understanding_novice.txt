### Human: Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant: Write a function that takes a dictionary of students with their exam scores as input and returns the average score of all students. If the dictionary is empty, return 0.

```python
students = {
    'Alice': 90,
    'Bob': 85,
    'Charlie': 95
}
```

### Human: I think it's something like... we need to use a loop to go through each student in the dictionary and add up all their scores, then divide by the number of students? But how do we get the number of students from the dictionary? And what if there are no students at all?

```python
def average_score(students):
    total = 0
    count = len(students) # Is this right?
    for student in students:
        total += students[student]
    return total / count

students = {
    'Alice': 90,
    'Bob': 85,
    'Charlie': 95
}

print(average_score(students))
```
Wait, what's going to happen if the dictionary is empty?

### Assistant: Your code is on the right track! However, you're missing a condition to handle an empty dictionary.

To get the number of students from the dictionary, `len(students)` is indeed correct. But consider what happens when there are no students at all (i.e., an empty dictionary).

Let's move on to a medium question:

Write a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string with all vowels removed. For example, if the input is "Hello World", the output should be "Hll Wrld".

```python
def remove_vowels(s):
    # Your code here
```

### Human: I think it's something like... we need to use a loop or a function that goes through each character in the string? And then check if it's a vowel, and if not, add it to the new string? Um...

```python
def remove_vowels(s):
    new_string = ""
    for i in s:
        if i == "a" or i == "e" or i == "i" or i == "o" or i == "u":
            # I think we need to do something here, but I'm not sure what
            pass
        else:
            new_string += i
    return new_string
```

But wait, I'm not sure if this is right... Do I need to use a list instead of a string? And how do I make it case-insensitive?

### Assistant: You're close! Your loop is a good start, but you forgot to add the character to the new string when it's not a vowel.

As for making it case-insensitive, think about how you can check if a character is uppercase or lowercase before deciding whether to count it as a vowel.

Let's move on to an EASY question:

What will be printed out by this code?

```python
x = 5
y = x + 3
print(x)
```

Remember to run the code in your Python interpreter to see what happens.

### Human: I think it's going to print out... um, wait, is it 8? No, that can't be right... I'm pretty sure it prints out 5...

I'll just try running this in my interpreter real quick... *runs code* ...yep, it says 5! That makes sense, because we only print out the value of x, not y. So even though y is equal to x + 3, that doesn't affect what's printed when we call print(x).

### Assistant: You're absolutely right that `print(x)` will output 5, because you've only modified the value of `y`, not `x`.

Well done! You correctly ran the code in your interpreter to test your understanding.

Here's a new EASY question:

Write an if/else statement to check if the variable `age` is greater than or equal to 18. If it is, print "You're an adult!", otherwise print "You're still a kid!"

### Human: I think I can do this...

if age >= 18:
print("You're an adult!")
else
print("You're still a kid!")

### Assistant: Your code is almost there! However, in Python, you need a colon (:) at the end of the if/else statement block, and an indentation to indicate that it's part of the block.

So, your corrected code would be:
```python
if age >= 18:
    print("You're an adult!")
else:
    print("You're still a kid!")
```
Well done!

Now, let's move on to a HARD question:

Write a function that takes two strings as input and returns the longest common substring between them. For example, if the inputs are "banana" and "anana", the output should be "ana".

```python
def longest_common_substring(s1, s2):
    # Your code here
```

### Human: I don't understand what's going on with this one... I mean, we've been doing simple things like print statements and if/else, but now it seems like we're talking about complicated stuff involving functions and substrings. Can we do something easier? This looks way over my head... How can a function even compare two strings to find the longest common part of them?

### Assistant: It's normal to feel overwhelmed when encountering new concepts.

Your previous code was mostly on track, but you missed the colon at the end of the if statement and had an extra "print" before the else clause.

Let's move on to a MEDIUM question:

Write a function that takes a string as input and returns its reverse. For example, if the input is "hello", the output should be "olleh".

```python
def reverse_string(s):
    # Your code here
```

This one involves using functions and string manipulation, but it's still a manageable task. Give it a shot!

### Human: I think it's something like... we need to use slicing or indexing to get the characters from the end of the string and then concatenate them in reverse order? But how do I actually implement that in code?

Here's my attempt:
```python
def reverse_string(s):
    new_s = ""
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == s[len(s) - 1]:
            new_s += s[i]
    return new_s

# but wait, how do I actually add the characters from the end of the string to the beginning?
```
I'm not sure if this is even close to correct...

### Assistant: Your attempt is close, but you're overcomplicating things with the if statement and trying to compare each character with the last one.

Think about it like this: you want to take the original string and reverse its order. You could do this by starting from the end of the string and moving backwards to the beginning, adding each character to a new string as you go.

Here's an EASY question:

What will be printed out by this code?

```python
x = 2 * 3 + 4
print(x)
```

Remember, it's just basic arithmetic!

### Human: I think I get what you mean about reversing the string. So, like, instead of comparing each character with the last one, I could just start from the end and add them to a new string in reverse order... yeah!

And now, let me try this easy question...

So, the code is x = 2 * 3 + 4. First, it does the multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6. Then it adds 4: 6 + 4 = 10. So, x will be 10... and then it prints out... 10! Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's right.

### Assistant: Your code for reversing a string is on the right track now! You just need to start from the end of the string and add each character to a new string in reverse order.

And great job on solving the easy question about arithmetic operations!

Here's a MEDIUM question:

Write a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list. For example, if the input is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the output should be 6 (because 2 + 4 = 6).

```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    # Your code here
```

Remember to use a loop or function to iterate through the list and add up only the even numbers. Good luck!

### Human: I think it's something like... I'll use a for loop, because that's what we did in class, right? Um, let me see...

```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    total = 0
    for x in numbers:
        if x % == 0:  # wait, is this the way to check if a number is even?
            total += x
    return total
```

I'm not really sure how to finish it off... I feel like there's something missing...
