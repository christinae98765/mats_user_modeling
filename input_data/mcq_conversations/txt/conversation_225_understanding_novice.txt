    return x + y
result = add(3, 7)

A) 3
B) 10
C) 7

That's not quite right. The function adds the two parameters together.

Let's move on. What will this code print?

        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

A) 10
B) 24
C) 4
D) Error

### Human:

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function multiplies all numbers from 1 to n.

Here's the next question:

my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}
my_dict['age'] = 26

A) 'Alice'
B) 25
C) 26

That's not quite right. The dictionary value was reassigned to 26.

Next question:

What does this code output?
word = "hello"
print(word.upper())

D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Option B shows the correct syntax for defining a class with an initializer.
