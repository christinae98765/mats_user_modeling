### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What is the output of print(5 * 2)?
A) 10
B) 52
C) 7
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will this code print?
x = "hello"
print(x)

A) hello
B) x
C) Error
D) None

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the output of print(10 - 3 + 2)?
A) 5
B) 9
C) 15
D) 8

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B (9), but let me explain: 10 - 3 is 7, then 7 + 2 is 9. Next question:

What does this function return?
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
result = add(3, 5)
print(result)

A) a + b
B) 8
C) 35
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function returns the actual sum, which is 8. Next question:

What is the output of this code?
words = "Python"
print(words.lower())

A) PYTHON
B) python
C) Python
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The .lower() method converts the string to lowercase, so the output is 'python'. Next question:

What will this code print?
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
print(factorial(3))

A) 3
B) 6
C) 9
D) 1

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The factorial of 3 is 3 * 2 * 1 = 6. Next question:

What is the output of this code?
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print(my_dict["name"])

A) Alice
B) name
