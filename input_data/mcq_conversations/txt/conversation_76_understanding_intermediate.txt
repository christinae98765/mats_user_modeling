### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

Question 1: What does the following function return?

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)

A) 8
B) "5, 3"
C) 53
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Moving on.

Question 2: What is the output of the following code?

x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 13
B) 7
C) 103
D) 30

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.

Question 3: What will this code print?

name = "Python"
print(name + " is fun")

A) Python is fun
B) Pythonis fun
C) name + " is fun"
D) Python

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's the next one.

Question 4: What is the output of this code?

if 5 > 3:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")

A) No
B) Yes
C) 5 > 3
D) True

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Moving to a harder question.

Question 5: Consider this recursive function. What does it return when called with mystery(4)?

def mystery(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * mystery(n - 1)

A) 24
B) 10
C) 4
D) 0

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is A - this function calculates factorial, so mystery(4) = 4×3×2×1 = 24.

Question 6: What will this code output?

data = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'city': 'NYC'}
print(data['age'])

A) Alice
B) age
C) 25
D) KeyError

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is C - accessing a dictionary with a key returns the value associated with that key, which is 25.

Question 7: What does this code do?

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def bark(self):
        return self.name + " says woof"

my_dog = Dog("Buddy")
print(my_dog.bark())

A) Prints "Dog says woof"
B) Prints "Buddy says woof"
C) Creates a variable named Dog
D) Prints "bark"

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B - the class creates an instance with name "Buddy", and calling bark() returns "Buddy says woof".

Question 8: What is the result of this code?

def greet(person):
    message = "Hello, " + person
    return message

greeting = greet("World")
print(greeting)

A) Hello, World
B) person
C) greet
D) Error

### Human:
A
