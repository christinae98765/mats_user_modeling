### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions to practice your Python skills.

What will this code print?
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(name + " is " + str(age))

A) Alice is 25
B) Alice is age
C) name is 25
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does the following function return?
def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y
result = multiply(4, 5)
print(result)

A) 45
B) 20
C) 9
D) 4 5

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's a harder one:

What will this code output?
data = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
for key in data:
    if data[key] > 1:
        print(key)

A) a b c
B) b c
C) 2 3
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The condition checks if the value is greater than 1, so only 'b' and 'c' print.

Let's move on:

What is the output of this code?
for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0
1
2
D) 3

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does this code do?
text = "Python"
print(text.lower())

A) PYTHON
B) python
C) Python
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's the next one:

What will be printed?
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
for num in nums:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(num)

A) 1 3
B) 2 4
C) 1
3
D) 2
4

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's a challenging question:

What will this code output?
def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
print(factorial(4))

A) 4
B) 10
C) 24
D) 16

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The factorial function multiplies 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24.

Final question:

What is the output of this code?
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("Greater")
else:
    print("Lesser")

A) Lesser
B) Greater
C) 10
D) Error

### Human:
B
