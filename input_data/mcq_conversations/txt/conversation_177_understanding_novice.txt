### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What does the following function return when called with the argument 5?

def double(x):
    return x * 2

A) 10
B) 25
C) 5
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function multiplies the input by 2, so double(5) returns 10. Let's move on.

What is the output of the following code?
name = "Alice"
print(name)

A) name
B) Alice
C) "Alice"
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Consider this code:
my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
result = my_dict.get("d", 0)

What is the value of result?

A) None
B) KeyError
C) 0
D) Undefined

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The get() method returns the default value (0) when the key doesn't exist. Let's continue.

What will this recursive function return when called with n=3?

def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

A) 3
B) 6
C) 9
D) Error

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function recursively calculates 3 × 2 × 1 = 6. Next question:

What is the output of the following code?
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 7
B) 13
C) 30
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Which of the following correctly opens a file for reading in Python?

A) open("file.txt", "w")
B) open("file.txt", "r")
C) open("file.txt", "x")
D) open("file.txt", "a")

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The "w" mode opens a file for writing. To read a file, you use "r" mode. Next question:

What will this code output?
for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0\n1\n2
D) 3

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does the following code do?

words = ["hello", "world"]
result = " ".join(words)

A) Creates a list of two words separated by a space
B) Returns "helloworld"
C) Returns "hello world"
D) Returns ["hello", " ", "world"]

### Human:
B
