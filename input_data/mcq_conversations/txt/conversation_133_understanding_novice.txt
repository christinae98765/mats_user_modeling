### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions to practice your Python skills.

What does the following function return?

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)

A) 53
B) 8
C) 35
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. When you call add_numbers(5, 3), it adds the two numbers together.

What is the output of the following code?

text = "Python"
print(text.lower())

A) PYTHON
B) Python
C) python
D) pYTHON

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The .lower() method converts all characters to lowercase.

Consider this code with a while loop:

count = 0
while count < 3:
    print(count)
    count = count + 1

How many times does it print?

A) 2 times
B) 3 times
C) 4 times
D) Infinite loop

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The loop runs while count is less than 3, so it prints 0, 1, and 2.

What will this code output?

def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(4))

A) 4
B) 10
C) 24
D) 16

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This recursive function multiplies: 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24.

Consider this code with a dictionary:

student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 20, "grade": "A"}
print(student["age"])

What is printed?

A) Alice
B) 20
C) A
D) KeyError

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The key "age" maps to the value 20.

What is the output of this code?

num = 10
if num > 5:
    print("Greater")
else:
    print("Less or equal")

A) Greater
B) Less or equal
C) Both
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct.

What is the output of the following?

x = 7
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 10
B) 4
C) 73
D) 3

### Human:
B
