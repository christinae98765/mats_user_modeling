### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions to test your Python skills.

What does the following function return?

def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

result = greet("Alice")

A) "Hello, Alice"
B) "Hello, " + "Alice"
C) None
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Moving on.

Consider this code:

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, species):
        self.species = species
    
    def describe(self):
        return f"I am a {self.species}"

dog = Animal("dog")

Which statement would cause an error?
A) dog.describe()
B) dog.species = "cat"
C) dog.legs
D) print(dog.describe())

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is C—attempting to access dog.legs would cause an AttributeError since legs was never defined.

Next question:

What is the output of this recursive function?

def mystery(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)

print(mystery(4))

A) 10
B) 24
C) 4
D) 120

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is D—mystery(4) computes 4! (4 factorial), which is 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24... actually 24 is the correct value. Let me recalculate: 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24. The correct answer is B, so you were right!

Wait, let me verify: mystery(4) = 4 * mystery(3) = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24. Your answer B is correct.

Next question:

What is the output of the following code?

x = 5
if x > 3:
    print("Greater")
else:
    print("Lesser")

A) Greater
B) Lesser
C) No output
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does the following code output?

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2
C) 3 2 1
D) 0 1 2 3

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the value of x after this code runs?

x = 10
if x < 20:
    x = x + 5
else:
    x = x - 5

A) 5
B) 15
C) 10
D) 20

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B, and you selected B, so you're correct!

Next question:

Consider this code with a dictionary:

data = {"name": "Bob", "age": 30, "city": "NYC"}
result = data.get("country", "Unknown")

What is the value of result?
A) KeyError
B) None
C) "Unknown"
D) "Bob"

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is C—the .get() method returns the default value "Unknown" when the key "country" doesn't exist.

Next question:

What will this code print?

text = "Python"
print(text[0:2])

A) Py
B) Pyt
C) yth
D) on

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Which function would you use to find the length of a list?

A) len(list)
B) list.length()
C) list.size()
D) length(list)

### Human:
A
