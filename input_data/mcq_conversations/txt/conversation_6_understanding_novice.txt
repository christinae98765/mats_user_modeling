### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Let's try another one.

### Human:
B

### Assistant:

A) 'age'
B) 25
C) 26
D) {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 26}

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Next question.

What is the output of this recursive function?
def countdown(n):

        return
    print(n)
    countdown(n - 1)
countdown(3)

A) 0
B) 3 2 1

D) The class cannot be instantiated

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Let's finish with one more question.
