### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice.

Consider this code:
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

d = Dog("Buddy")
print(d.speak())
```
What is printed?
A) Sound
B) Woof
C) None
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The Dog class overrides the speak() method, so it returns "Woof".

Next question: What does the following return?
```python
text = "python"
print(text.upper())
```
A) python
B) PYTHON
C) Python
D) PYTHON()

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question: What is the output of this code?
```python
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

print(fib(4))
```
A) 3
B) 4
C) 5
D) 6

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. fib(4) = fib(3) + fib(2), which equals 3 + 2 = 5.

Next question: What does this code output?
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[1])
```
A) apple
B) banana
C) cherry
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question: What is the output?
```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)
```
A) 13
B) 7
C) 30
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question: What does this code print?
```python
data = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
for key in data:
    if data[key] > 1:
        print(key)
```
A) a
B) b c
C) b and c on separate lines
D) 1 2 3

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The code prints the keys where the value is greater than 1, which are "b" and "c" on separate lines.

Next question: What is printed?
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(name + " is " + str(age))
```
A) name is age
B) Alice is 25
C) Alice is age
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Last question: What does this print?
```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
```
A) 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2 3
C) 0 1 2
D) 3

### Human:
C
