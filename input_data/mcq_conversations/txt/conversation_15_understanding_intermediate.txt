### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

Consider this code:
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

d = Dog("Rex")
print(d.speak())
```
What is printed?
A) Some sound
B) Woof
C) Rex
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The Dog class overrides the speak method, so it returns "Woof".

Next question: What will this recursive function return when called with factorial(4)?
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
```
A) 16
B) 24
C) 10
D) 4

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Let me move on to the next question.

What is the output of this code?
```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)
```
A) 7
B) 13
C) 30
D) 103

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Now for a harder question:

Given this dictionary:
```python
data = {"a": [1, 2, 3], "b": [4, 5, 6]}
result = data["a"][1] + data["b"][2]
print(result)
```
What is printed?
A) 6
B) 11
C) 8
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. data["a"][1] is 2 and data["b"][2] is 6, which adds to 8.

Next question: Consider this code with nested lists:
```python
matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
for row in matrix:
    if row[0] > 2:
        print(row[1])
```
What is printed?
A) 2
B) 4 and 6
C) 3 and 5
D) Error

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The code prints correctly.

Let's try another one: What does this code output?
```python
name = "Python"
print(name + " is fun")
```
A) Python is fun
B) Pythonisfun
C) name is fun
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's the next question:

What will this code print?
```python
def greet(person, greeting="Hello"):
    return greeting + ", " + person

print(greet("Alice", "Hi"))
```
A) Hello, Alice
B) Hi, Alice
C) Alice, Hi
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Final question:

What is the output of this code?
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    if fruit.startswith("b"):
        print(fruit.upper())
```
A) APPLE
B) BANANA
C) CHERRY
D) Error

### Human:
B
