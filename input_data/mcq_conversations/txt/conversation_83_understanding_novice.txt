### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some Python questions to practice.

What is the output of this code?
print(5 * 2)

A) 10
B) 52
C) 7
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Now for the next question.

What will this code print?
x = "Hello"
print(x + " World")

A) Hello World
B) x + World
C) HelloWorld
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Moving on.

What does this function return?
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b
result = add_numbers(3, 4)

A) 34
B) 7
C) "3 4"
D) Nothing

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds the two numbers together.

What is the output of this code?
words = ["cat", "dog", "bird"]
print(words[1])

A) cat
B) dog
C) bird
D) Index error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Remember that list indexing starts at 0.

Consider this code. What would be printed?
data = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
for key in data:
    print(key)

A) Alice 25
B) name age
C) {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
D) 0 1

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. When you iterate over a dictionary, you get the keys.

What is the output of this recursive function?
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
print(factorial(4))

A) 4
B) 10
C) 24
D) 16

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The factorial of 4 is 4 × 3 × 2 × 1.
