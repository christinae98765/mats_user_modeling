### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

What does the following code output?
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

dog = Dog("Rex")
print(dog.speak())
```
A) Some sound
B) Woof
C) Rex
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The Dog class overrides the speak() method, so it returns "Woof" instead of the parent's implementation.

Next question: What does this code output?
```python
text = "python"
print(text.upper())
```
A) PYTHON
B) python
C) Python
D) pYTHON

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct! The upper() method converts all characters to uppercase.

Next question: What is the output of the following code?
```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)
```
A) 13
B) 7
C) 30
D) 3.33

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct! 10 minus 3 equals 7.

Next question: What does this recursive function return when called with fibonacci(4)?
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
A) 2
B) 3
C) 4
D) 5

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Let's trace through it: fibonacci(4) calls fibonacci(3) + fibonacci(2), which evaluates to 3 + 2 = 5.

Next question: What does this code print?
```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
```
A) 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2
C) 3
D) 0 1 2 3

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct! The range(3) function generates values 0, 1, and 2.

Next question: Consider this nested dictionary structure. What is the value of result?
```python
data = {"user": {"profile": {"age": 25}}}
result = data["user"]["profile"]["age"]
```
A) {"profile": {"age": 25}}
B) 25
C) "age"
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. You need to follow the nested keys: data["user"] gives the user dictionary, ["profile"] gives the profile dictionary, and ["age"] retrieves the value 25.

Next question: What does this function return when called with get_sum([1, 2, 3, 4])?
```python
def get_sum(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total
```
A) 10
B) 4
C) [1, 2, 3, 4]
D) None

### Human:
A
