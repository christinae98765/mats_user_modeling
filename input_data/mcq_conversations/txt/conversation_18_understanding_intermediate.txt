What does the following recursive function return when called with fib(4)?

    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

A) 2
B) 3

That's not quite right. The answer is B.

Consider this dictionary:

That's not quite right. The answer is C, because "gpa" is not a key in the dictionary.

What is the output of this code?
