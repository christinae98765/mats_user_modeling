d = Dog("Buddy")
print(d.speak())

A) Buddy barks
B) Dog barks
C) Error: __init__ not defined
D) "Buddy barks"

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is A - the instance name "Buddy" is stored in self.name.

Let's try another question.

Correct. Next question.

Consider this recursive function:

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * mystery(n - 1)

What does mystery(4) return?
A) 4
B) 24
C) 10
D) Error: infinite recursion

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B - this function calculates 4!, which equals 24.

Next question.

What will this code do?

A) 2
B) 10
C) 3
D) Error: invalid key

### Human:

Let's continue.
