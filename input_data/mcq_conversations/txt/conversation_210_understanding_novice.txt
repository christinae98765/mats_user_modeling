### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions to help you practice Python.

What does the following function return?
```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b
result = add_numbers(5, 3)
```
A) 8
B) "5 3"
C) 53
D) Nothing

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds the two parameters together, so it returns 8. Next question:

What is the output of this code?
```python
text = "Python"
print(text.lower())
```
A) PYTHON
B) python
C) Python
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The .lower() method converts text to lowercase, so it prints "python". Let's try a harder one:

What will this code print?
```python
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print(my_dict["age"])
```
A) "age"
B) "Alice"
C) 25
D) KeyError

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Dictionary keys access their values, so my_dict["age"] returns 25. Here's an easier one:

What is the output of the following code?
```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)
```
A) 7
B) 13
C) "10 3"
D) 103

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will this recursive function return when called with fibonacci(4)?
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
A) 2
B) 3
C) 4
D) 5

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The fibonacci sequence gives us 0, 1, 1, 2, 3... so fibonacci(4) is 3. Next:

What does this code output?
```python
name = "Sam"
print("Hello " + name)
```
A) Hello Sam
B) "Hello Sam"
C) Hello + Sam
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Last question:

What will this code print?
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, species):
        self.species = species
    def info(self):
        return f"I am a {self.species}"

dog = Animal("dog")
print(dog.info())
```
A) Animal
B) I am a dog
C) None
D) Error

### Human:
C
