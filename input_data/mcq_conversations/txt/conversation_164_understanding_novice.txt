### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions.

Question 1: What will this code output?
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

dog = Dog("Rex")
print(dog.speak())
```
A) Some sound
B) Woof
C) Rex
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The Dog class overrides the speak method, so it returns "Woof".

Question 2: What does this recursive function return when called with mystery(5)?
```python
def mystery(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)
```
A) 5
B) 120
C) 15
D) 25

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This calculates factorial, so mystery(5) = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.

Question 3: What is the output of this code?
```python
data = {'a': [1, 2, 3], 'b': {'x': 10}}
result = data['b']['x'] + data['a'][1]
print(result)
```
A) 12
B) [1, 2, 3]
C) 10
D) Error

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The code accesses nested dictionary and list values correctly: 10 + 2 = 12.

Question 4: What is the output of this code?
```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)
```
A) 13
B) 7
C) 30
D) 103

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Question 5: What does this code output?
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_list.pop(2)
print(my_list)
```
A) [1, 2, 4, 5]
B) [1, 2, 3, 4]
C) [2, 3, 4, 5]
D) [3]

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. pop(2) removes the element at index 2, which is 3, leaving [1, 2, 4, 5].

Question 6: What is the output of this code?
```python
def add_suffix(word):
    return word + "_end"

result = add_suffix("hello")
print(result)
```
A) hello_end
B) helloend
C) _end
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. String concatenation joins the strings with the underscore included: "hello" + "_end" = "hello_end".

Question 7: What does this code output?
```python
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print(count)
    count = count + 2
print("done")
```
A) 0 1 2 done
B) 0 2 done
C) 0 2 4 done
D) done

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The loop prints 0, then 2, then stops because 4 is not less than 3.

Question 8: What is the output of print("Hello" + " " + "World")?
A) HelloWorld
B) Hello World
C) Hello + World
D) Error

### Human:
B
