### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some Python questions.

What is the output of this code?
print(10 - 3)

A) 7
B) 13
C) 103
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Let's continue.

What does this code print?
x = "Hello"
print(x)

A) x
B) Hello
C) 'Hello'
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the output of this code?
text = "python"
print(text.upper())

A) PYTHON
B) python
C) Python
D) pYTHON

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The upper() method converts text to uppercase.

What will this code output?
if 5 > 3:
    print("yes")
else:
    print("no")

A) no
B) yes
C) Error
D) 5 > 3

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's a harder question:

Consider this recursive function. What does it return when called with factorial(3)?

def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

A) 3
B) 6
C) 9
D) 1

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function multiplies all numbers down to 1.

What is the output of this code using a dictionary?
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print(person["age"])

A) Alice
B) name
C) 25
D) KeyError

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Dictionary keys are used to access values.

What does this code output?
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
for num in numbers:
    print(num * 2, end=" ")

A) 2 4 6 8
B) 1 2 3 4
C) [2, 4, 6, 8]
D) 24

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The loop prints values directly, not as a list.

What will this code print?
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

print(greet("Bob"))

A) greet("Bob")
B) Hello, Bob
C) Hello, name
D) None

### Human:
A
