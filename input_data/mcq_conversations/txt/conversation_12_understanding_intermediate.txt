### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions.

What will this code output?

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} makes a sound"

dog = Animal("Rex")
print(dog.speak())

A) Rex makes a sound
B) Animal makes a sound
C) <Animal object at 0x...>
D) Error: speak() is not defined

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The __init__ method initializes the object, and speak() returns a formatted string.

What does the append() method do in Python?

A) Removes the last element from a list
B) Adds an element to the end of a list
C) Sorts a list in ascending order
D) Returns the length of a list

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Consider this recursive function:

def mystery(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)

What is mystery(4)?

A) 4
B) 10
C) 24
D) 64

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function multiplies n by the result of mystery(n-1), so it calculates the factorial.

Which string method would convert "hello" to "HELLO"?

A) upper()
B) capitalize()
C) uppercase()
D) to_upper()

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will this code print?

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for i in range(len(my_list)):
    if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:
        print(my_list[i])

A) 1, 3, 5
B) 2, 4
C) 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
D) 4, 5

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the value of x after this code runs?

x = 10
x = x + 5

A) 5
B) 10
C) 15
D) 105

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will this code output?

name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(name + " is " + str(age) + " years old")

A) Alice is 25 years old
B) Alice is age years old
C) Error: cannot concatenate str and int
D) Alice25 years old

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Last question:

What will this function return when called with my_function(5)?

def my_function(x):
    result = 0
    for i in range(x):
        result += i
    return result

A) 10
B) 15
C) 5
D) 25
