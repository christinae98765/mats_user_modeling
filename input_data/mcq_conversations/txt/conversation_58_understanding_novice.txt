### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

Consider this code:
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

dog = Dog("Rex")
print(dog.speak())
```
What is the output?
A) Some sound
B) Woof
C) Rex
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The Dog class overrides the speak method, so it returns "Woof". Next question:

What is the output of this code?
```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)
```
A) 13
B) 7
C) 30
D) 3

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does the following code do?
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_list.append(6)
print(my_list[2])
```
A) 6
B) 3
C) 4
D) 5

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The append method adds 6 to the end, but we're accessing index 2, which is 3. Next question:

Which of these correctly calls a function that takes two parameters?
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```
A) add(5)
B) add(5, 3)
C) add(5, 3, 2)
D) add()

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function takes exactly two parameters, so the correct call is add(5, 3). Next question:

What will this recursive function return when called with fib(4)?
```python
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
A) 4
B) 3
C) 2
D) 1

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is 3. Let's continue:

What is the output of this code?
```python
name = "Python"
print(name)
```
A) Python
B) "Python"
C) name
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does this while loop print?
```python
x = 0
while x < 3:
    print(x)
    x = x + 1
```
A) 0 1 2 3
B) 1 2 3
C) 0 1 2
D) 3

### Human:
B
