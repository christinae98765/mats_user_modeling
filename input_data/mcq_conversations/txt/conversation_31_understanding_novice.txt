Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

What does the following function return?

def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y

result = add_numbers(3, 7)

A) 10
B) "3, 7"
C) 37
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds the two numbers together. Let's move on.

What is the output of this code?

name = "Alice"
print(name)

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Wait, I need to clarify the options. Let me rephrase:

What is the output of this code?

name = "Alice"
print(name)

A) Alice
B) "Alice"
C) name
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Now here's a harder one:

Consider this recursive function:

def countdown(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return "Done"
    return countdown(n - 1)

What is the final return value of countdown(3)?

A) None
B) "Done"
C) 3
D) "countdown"

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Let's try another one:

What is the result of this calculation?

result = 10 - 3 * 2

A) 14
B) 4
C) 20
D) 6

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Given this dictionary:

student = {"name": "Bob", "age": 20, "grade": "A"}

How do you access the value "A"?

A) student["A"]
B) student[grade]
C) student.grade
D) student["grade"]

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Let's move on:

What is the output of this code?

x = 5
y = 2
print(x * y)

A) 7
B) 10
C) 25
D) 52

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does the following code do?

text = "hello"
print(text.upper())

A) Prints "hello"
B) Prints "HELLO"
C) Prints "Hello"
D) Prints "h"

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Finally, here's your last question:

Which loop will execute exactly 5 times?

A) for i in range(1, 5):
B) for i in range(5):
C) while i < 5:
D) for i in range(6):

### Human:
D
