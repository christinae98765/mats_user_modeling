### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions.

Question 1: What will this code output?

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} barks"

d = Dog("Rex")
print(d.speak())

A) Rex
B) Rex barks
C) Dog barks
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The method returns a formatted string with the dog's name.

Question 2: What does this recursive function return when called with fib(4)?

def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

A) 2
B) 3
C) 4
D) 5

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. You need to trace through the recursive calls: fib(4) = fib(3) + fib(2), which evaluates to 3.

Question 3: Given this dictionary and code, what is the output?

data = {"a": [1, 2, 3], "b": {"x": 10, "y": 20}}
result = data["b"]["x"] + len(data["a"])
print(result)

A) 13
B) 123
C) 30
D) Error

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This code successfully accesses nested structures: 10 + 3 = 13.

Question 4: What will this function return?

def process(items):
    result = []
    for item in items:
        if item % 2 == 0:
            result.append(item * 2)
    return result

print(process([1, 2, 3, 4]))

A) [1, 2, 3, 4]
B) [2, 4, 6, 8]
C) [4, 8]
D) [2, 8]

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function only doubles even numbers, so it returns [4, 8].

Question 5: What is the output of this code?

name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(name + " is " + str(age))

A) Alice is 25
B) name is age
C) Alice is age
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct.

Question 6: What does this code print?

x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("big")
else:
    print("small")

A) small
B) big
C) Error
D) big small

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct.

Question 7: What is the output of this code?

text = "PYTHON"
result = text.lower().replace("p", "j")
print(result)

A) PYTHON
B) jython
C) JYTHON
D) python

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The lower() method converts to lowercase first, then replace() changes 'p' to 'j', giving "jython".

Question 8: What will this code output?

def add_item(lst, item):
    lst.append(item)
    return lst

my_list = [1, 2]
add_item(my_list, 3)
print(my_list)

A) [1, 2]
B) [1, 2, 3]
C) 3
D) None

### Human:
C
