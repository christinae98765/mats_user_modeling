### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What does the following function return?

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)

A) 8
B) 53
C) 35
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds the two numbers together, so 5 + 3 = 8. Next question:

What is the output of this code?

x = 10
y = 4
print(x - y)

A) 14
B) 6
C) 40
D) 104

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does this code print?

name = "Python"
print(name)

A) name
B) Python
C) "Python"
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the output of this code?

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2
C) 3
D) 0 1 2 3

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will this code output?

def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(4))

A) 2
B) 3
C) 4
D) 5

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This recursive function calculates the 4th Fibonacci number, which is 3. Next question:

Consider this code:

words = ["cat", "dog", "bird"]
print(words[1].upper())

A) cat
B) DOG
C) dog
D) BIRD

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The code accesses index 1 (which is "dog") and converts it to uppercase, giving "DOG". Next question:

What is the output of this code?

count = 0
while count < 3:
    print(count)
    count = count + 1

A) 0 1 2 3
B) 1 2 3
C) 0 1 2
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The while loop prints 0, 1, and 2 (stopping before count reaches 3), so the output is 0 1 2. Final question:

What will this code do?

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def bark(self):
        return self.name + " says woof!"

my_dog = Dog("Buddy")
print(my_dog.bark())

A) Dog
B) Buddy says woof!
C) bark
D) Error

### Human:
C
