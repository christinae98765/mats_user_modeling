### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's begin with a question.

What will this code output?

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return self.name + " makes a sound"

dog = Animal("Rex")
print(dog.speak())

A) name makes a sound
B) Rex makes a sound
C) Animal makes a sound
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B—the instance attribute 'name' is set to 'Rex' when we create the object.

Next question: What does this code print?

x = 10
y = 5
print(x - y)

A) 15
B) 5
C) 105
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question: What is the output?

name = "Python"
print(name[0])

A) Python
B) P
C) 0
D) n

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question: What does this function return?

def multiply(a, b):
    result = a * b
    return result

print(multiply(4, 3))

A) 7
B) 12
C) 43
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B—the function multiplies 4 and 3 to get 12.

Next question: What does this code output?

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(4))

A) 24
B) 4
C) 16
D) Error

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is A—this recursive function calculates 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24.

Next question: Consider this code:

my_dict = {"apple": 5, "banana": 3, "orange": 8}
for key in my_dict:
    if my_dict[key] > 4:
        print(key)

What gets printed?

A) apple banana orange
B) apple orange
C) 5 8
D) apple 5 orange 8

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B—the code prints keys where the value is greater than 4, which are "apple" and "orange".

Next question: What is the output?

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0\n1\n2
D) 3

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question: Which function would reverse a string?

s = "hello"

A) s.reverse()
B) reverse(s)
C) s[::-1]
D) s.flip()

### Human:
A
