### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a challenging question.

Consider this code:
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

dog = Dog("Rex")
print(dog.speak())
```
What is the output?
A) Some sound
B) Woof
C) Rex
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The Dog class overrides the speak method, so it returns "Woof". Let's move on.

What does the following code output?
```python
def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)
```
A) "5 + 3"
B) 8
C) 53
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will this code print?

    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
