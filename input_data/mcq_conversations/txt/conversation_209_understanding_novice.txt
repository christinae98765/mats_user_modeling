### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What is the output of this code?
x = 10
print(x + 5)

A) 15
B) 10
C) 5
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Now let's try a function question.

What does this function return when called with func(3)?
def func(n):
    return n * 2 + 1

A) 6
B) 7
C) 8
D) 5

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B - when n=3, we get 3*2+1 = 7.

Let's move on. What will this code output?
mydict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
mydict['a'] = mydict['a'] + mydict['b']
print(mydict['a'])

A) 1
B) 2
C) 3
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is C - mydict['a'] becomes 1+2=3.

Here's an easier one. What is the output?
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(name + " is " + str(age))

A) Alice is 25
B) name is age
C) Alice is age
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Now a harder question about recursion.

What does this function return when called with mystery(4)?
def mystery(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * mystery(n - 1)

A) 4
B) 24
C) 16
D) 10

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B - this calculates 4*3*2*1 = 24.

Let's go back to basics. What is the output?
for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 0 1 2 (each on new line)
B) 1 2 3 (each on new line)
C) 3
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. One more easy question.

What is the value of x after this code runs?
x = 5
x = x * 2
x = x - 3

A) 10
B) 7
C) 12
D) 5

### Human:
B
