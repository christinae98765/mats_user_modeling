### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice.

Consider this code:
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

dog = Dog("Rex")
print(dog.speak())
```
What is the output?
A) Sound
B) Woof
C) Rex
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The Dog class overrides the speak method, so it returns "Woof".

Next question: What does the following code output?
```python
text = "hello"
result = text.upper()
print(result)
```
A) hello
B) HELLO
C) Hello
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct! The upper() method converts all characters to uppercase.

Next question: What is the output of this code?
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
total = sum(numbers)
print(total)
```
A) [1, 2, 3, 4]
B) 10
C) 4
D) 1234

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct! The sum() function adds all elements in the list.

Next question: Consider this code:
```python
my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
value = my_dict.get("b")
print(value)
```
What is the output?
A) 1
B) 2
C) "b"
D) KeyError

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct! The get() method retrieves the value for key "b", which is 2.

Next question: What is the output of this code?
```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)
```
A) 7
B) 13
C) 30
D) 3.33

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct! Now let's try a harder one. What does this recursive function return when called with factorial(4)?
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
```
A) 24
B) 4
C) 64
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function calculates 4 × 3 × 2 × 1, which equals 24.

Next question: What is the output of this code?
```python
def process(data):
    result = {}
    for key in data:
        result[key] = data[key] * 2
    return result

output = process({"x": 5, "y": 10})
print(output["x"])
```
A) 5
B) 10
C) 20
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function multiplies the values by 2, so output["x"] would be 10.

Next question: What is the output of this code?
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
message = name + " is " + str(age)
print(message)
```
A) Alice 25
B) Alice is 25
C) AliceiS25
D) Error

### Human:
B
