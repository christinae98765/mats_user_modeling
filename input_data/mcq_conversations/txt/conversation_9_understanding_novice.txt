### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions.

What will this code output?

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} makes a sound"

dog = Animal("Rex")
print(dog.speak())

A) Rex makes a sound
B) Animal makes a sound
C) name makes a sound
D) Error: __init__ not defined

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The code creates an instance with name="Rex", so it outputs "Rex makes a sound". Let's continue.

Consider this recursive function:

def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

What is factorial(4)?
A) 10
B) 24
C) 16
D) 256

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The factorial of 4 is 4×3×2×1 = 24. Moving on.

Which string method removes leading and trailing whitespace?

A) strip_all()
B) trim()
C) strip()
D) clean()

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct method is strip(). Next question.

What will this code output?

data = {"a": [1, 2, 3], "b": {"x": 10, "y": 20}}
print(data["b"]["x"] + data["a"][1])

A) 12
B) 130
C) Error
D) 20

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. data["b"]["x"] is 10 and data["a"][1] is 2, so the result is 12. Let's try another.

What is the output of print("Hello" + " " + "World")?
A) Hello World
B) HelloWorld
C) Hello + World
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.

Which of these correctly implements error handling?

A) try: x = 1/0 except: print("caught error")
B) try: x = 1/0 except ZeroDivisionError: print("caught error")
C) catch: x = 1/0 print("caught error")
D) error: x = 1/0 handle: print("caught error")

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Option B is correct—it specifically catches ZeroDivisionError. Here's the last one.

What is the output of x = [1, 2, 3]; x.append(4); print(len(x))?
A) 3
B) 4
C) [1, 2, 3, 4]
D) Error

### Human:
C
