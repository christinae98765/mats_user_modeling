### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

What does the following function return?

def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)

A) 8
B) 53
C) x + y
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds the two numbers together, not concatenates them as strings.

What will this code output?

def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(4))

A) 2
B) 3
C) 4
D) 5

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Let me move to the next question.

Which string method would convert 'hello' to 'HELLO'?

A) hello.uppercase()
B) hello.upper()
C) hello.capitalize()
D) hello.to_upper()

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Not quite. The correct method is upper().

What is the result of the following code?

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
my_list.append(5)
print(len(my_list))

A) 4
B) 5
C) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The len() function returns the count of items, not the list itself.

Consider this code with a dictionary:

my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'city': 'Boston'}
my_dict['age'] = 26
if my_dict['age'] > 25:
    print('Adult')
else:
    print('Young')

What is printed?

A) Young
B) Adult
C) 26
D) KeyError

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Dictionary access with valid keys doesn't cause an error.

What is the output of this code?

name = 'Python'
print('Hello, ' + name)

A) Hello, Python
B) Hello name
C) name
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does this code do?

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, species):
        self.species = species
    
    def speak(self):
        return f'{self.species} makes a sound'

dog = Animal('Dog')
print(dog.speak())

A) Returns 'Dog'
B) Returns 'Dog makes a sound'
C) Creates an empty object
D) Causes an error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The method returns the full string.

What is the output of this code?

x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 7
B) 13
C) Error
D) 103

### Human:
A
