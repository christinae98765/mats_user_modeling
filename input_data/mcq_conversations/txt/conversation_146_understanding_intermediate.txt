### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

Consider this code:
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

d = Dog("Rex")
print(d.speak())
```
What is the output?
A) Some sound
B) Woof
C) None
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The Dog class overrides the speak method, so it returns "Woof" instead of the parent's "Some sound".

Next question: What does the following code output?
```python
def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):
    return greeting + ", " + name

print(greet("Alice"))
```
A) greet("Alice")
B) Hello, Alice
C) Alice, Hello
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. The default parameter "Hello" is used when no greeting is provided.

Next question: What will this recursive function return when called with fib(4)?
```python
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
A) 2
B) 3
C) 4
D) 5

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Let me trace through: fib(4) = fib(3) + fib(2). Working backwards: fib(3)=2, fib(2)=1, so fib(4)=3.

Next question: What is the output of this code?
```python
x = 5
if x > 3:
    print("Greater")
else:
    print("Not greater")
```
A) Greater
B) Not greater
C) Both
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Since 5 is greater than 3, the if condition is true.

Next question: What will this code output?
```python
data = {"name": "Bob", "age": 30, "city": "NYC"}
data["age"] = 31
print(len(data))
```
A) 1
B) 2
C) 3
D) 4

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The dictionary has three key-value pairs ("name", "age", "city"), so len(data) returns 3, not 4.

Next question: What does this code output?
```python
text = "python"
print(text.upper())
```
A) PYTHON
B) python
C) Python
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. The upper() method converts all characters to uppercase.

Next question: What will this code print?
```python
def process(items):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(items)):
        if items[i] % 2 == 0:
            result.append(items[i] * 2)
    return result

print(process([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
```
A) [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
B) [4, 8]
C) [2, 8]
D) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function filters for even numbers (2 and 4), then doubles them, resulting in [4, 8].

Next question: What is the output of this code?
```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
```
A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0
   1
   2
D) Error

### Human:
C
