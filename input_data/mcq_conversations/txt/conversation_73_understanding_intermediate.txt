Correct. Next question:

What does this recursive function return when called with factorial(4)?
def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
A) 4
B) 24
C) 10
D) 16

x = x + 5
x = x * 2
A) 15

Correct. Next question:

Consider this class and code. What is the output?
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def bark(self):
        return self.name + " says woof"

d = Dog("Max")
print(d.bark())
A) Dog says woof
B) Max says woof
C) woof
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The method returns the dog's name concatenated with " says woof", so it prints "Max says woof". Next question:
