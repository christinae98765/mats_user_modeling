### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions to practice.

What does the following function return?

def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

result = greet("Alice")

What is the value of result?
A) "Hello, Alice"
B) "HelloAlice"
C) None
D) "greet"

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The string concatenation includes the space after the comma.

Consider this recursive function:

def countdown(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return n + countdown(n - 1)

What is countdown(4)?
A) 4
B) 10
C) 16
D) 24

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Not quite. Recursion adds values together as it returns back up the call stack.

What will this code output?

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
my_list.append(5)
print(len(my_list))

A) 4
B) 6
C) 5
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The append() method adds an element to the list.

Look at this class definition:

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def bark(self):
        return self.name + " says woof!"

my_dog = Dog("Buddy")
print(my_dog.bark())

What is printed?
A) "Dog says woof!"
B) "Buddy says woof!"
C) "bark"
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The bark() method returns a string combining the dog's name with the sound.

Which string method would convert "hello" to "HELLO"?
A) .lower()
B) .upper()
C) .capitalize()
D) .replace()

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct! Next question.

What is the output of the following code?

x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 7
B) 13
C) 30
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct! One more question.

What will this code print?

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2
C) 0\n1\n2 (printed on separate lines)
D) 3

### Human:
C
