### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

What will this code output?

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} barks"

d = Dog("Max")
print(d.speak())
```

A) Max barks
B) speak()
C) Dog barks
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is A - the method correctly uses the instance's name attribute.

Let's move on: What is the output of this code?

```python
name = "Python"
print(name + " is fun")
```

A) name is fun
B) Python is fun
C) "Python is fun"
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Consider this recursive function:

```python
def mystery(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)

print(mystery(4))
```

What is the output?

A) 4
B) 10
C) 24
D) 1

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is C - mystery(4) calculates 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24, which is the factorial function.

Next question: What does this print?

```python
x = 5
y = 10
print(y - x)
```

A) 15
B) 5
C) -5
D) 510

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will this code output?

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = my_list[1:4]
print(result)
```

A) [1, 2, 3]
B) [2, 3, 4]
C) [2, 3, 4, 5]
D) [4, 5]

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the output of this code?
