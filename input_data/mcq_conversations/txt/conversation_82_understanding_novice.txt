### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions to practice your Python skills.

What does the following function return?

def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y

result = add_numbers(3, 5)
print(result)

A) 8
B) 35
C) "3, 5"
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds the two parameters together, so 3 + 5 equals 8. Let's move on.

What is the output of this code?

name = "Python"
print(name)

A) name
B) Python
C) "Python"
D) undefined

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Which string method converts text to uppercase?

text = "hello"
result = text._____()

A) upper()
B) uppercase()
C) to_upper()
D) UPPER()

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct method is upper(). Let's try another.

Which of these correctly creates a dictionary and accesses a value?

A) my_dict = ["name", "age"]; print(my_dict["name"])
B) my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}; print(my_dict["name"])
C) my_dict = ("name", "age"); print(my_dict.name)
D) my_dict = {"name": "Alice"}; print(my_dict.get_name())

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Option B shows the correct syntax for creating and accessing a dictionary. Let's continue.

What is the output of this code?

x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 13
B) 7
C) 103
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Which of these correctly creates a variable and uses it in a string?

A) age = 16; print("I am" age "years old")
B) age = 16; print("I am " + str(age) + " years old")
C) 16 = age; print("I am" + age)
D) age = "16"; print("I am" + age + "years old")

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the output of this recursive function?

def countdown(n):
    if n == 0:
        return "Done"
    else:
        return countdown(n - 1)

print(countdown(2))

A) 2
B) 1
C) "Done"
D) infinite loop

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function recursively calls itself until n reaches 0, then returns "Done". Let's try the last one.

What does this while loop print?

i = 0
while i < 3:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1

A) 0 1 2
B) 0 1 2 3
C) 1 2 3
D) 3

### Human:
D
