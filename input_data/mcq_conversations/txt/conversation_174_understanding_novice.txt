### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions to practice your Python skills.

What does the following function return?
```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b
result = add_numbers(5, 3)
```
A) 8
B) "5 3"
C) None
D) 53

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function returns the sum of the two parameters, which is 8. Let's move on.

Consider this recursive function. What is the output of factorial(4)?
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
```
A) 10
B) 24
C) 4
D) 16

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Factorial(4) would be 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24.

What will this code print?
```python
name = "Python"
print(name)
```
A) name
B) Python
C) "Python"
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.

What does the split() method do in Python?
```python
sentence = "Hello World Python"
words = sentence.split()
```
A) Joins the string with spaces
B) Removes all vowels from the string
C) Splits the string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter
D) Converts the string to uppercase

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The split() method splits the string into a list of words.

What is the output of this code?
```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)
```
A) 13
B) 7
C) 103
D) 30

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.

What will this code output?
```python
data = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print(data.get("email", "Not found"))
```
A) alice
B) 25
C) "Not found"
D) KeyError

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The get() method returns the default value "Not found" because "email" is not a key in the dictionary.

What does this code do?
```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def bark(self):
        return self.name + " says woof!"
```
A) Creates a function called Dog
B) Defines a class Dog with an initializer and a bark method
C) Creates an error because classes need no methods
D) Defines a variable named Dog

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This code defines a class Dog with methods to initialize and describe the dog's bark.

What is the value of result?
```python
result = 5 * 2 + 3
```
A) 13
B) 25
C) 16
D) 40

### Human:
A
