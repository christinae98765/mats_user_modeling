### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What is the output of the following code?
```
x = 10
y = 3
print(x + y)
```
A) 13
B) 103
C) 30
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Now for a harder question:

What will this code output?
```
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

dog = Dog("Rex")
print(dog.speak())
```
A) Some sound
B) Woof
C) Rex
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The Dog class overrides the speak method to return "Woof". Next question:

What will this code print?
```
name = "Python"
print(name[0])
```
A) P
B) Python
C) 0
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the output of this code?
```
def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

result = multiply(4, 5)
print(result)
```
A) 20
B) 45
C) 9
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Now a harder one:

What will this code output?
```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(5))
```
A) 3
B) 5
C) 8
D) 13

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. fibonacci(5) returns 5. Let's continue:

What does this code print?
```
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
```
A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0 1 2 (each on a new line)
D) 3

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the output of this code?
```
text = "Hello" + " " + "World"
print(text)
```
A) Hello World
B) HelloWorld
C) Hello  World
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Final question:

What will this code output?
```
