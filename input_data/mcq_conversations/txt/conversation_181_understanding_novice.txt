### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's get started.

What does the following function return?

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(3, 5)

A) 8
B) "3 5"
C) 35
D) None

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds the two parameters together, so 3 + 5 = 8. Let's move on.

Which string method would convert 'hello' to 'HELLO'?
A) .lower()
B) .upper()
C) .capitalize()
D) .replace()

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. .upper() converts text to uppercase. Next question:

What is the output of this code?
name = "Python"
print(name)

A) name
B) Python
C) "Python"
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Consider this code:
data = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "NYC"}
print(data["country"])

What happens?
A) Prints None
B) Prints an empty string
C) Raises a KeyError
D) Prints "country"

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Accessing a key that doesn't exist in a dictionary raises a KeyError. Next question:

What is the output of this code?
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 7
B) 13
C) "10 - 3"
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will this code print?
for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 0, 1, 2 (on separate lines)
B) 1, 2, 3 (on separate lines)
C) 0, 1, 2, 3 (on separate lines)
D) range(3)

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Consider this recursive function:
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

What is factorial(4)?
A) 24
B) 10
C) 4
D) 16

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The factorial of 4 is 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24. Final question:

Which of these will create a list with the numbers 1 through 5?
A) list = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
B) list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
C) list = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
D) list = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

### Human:
D
