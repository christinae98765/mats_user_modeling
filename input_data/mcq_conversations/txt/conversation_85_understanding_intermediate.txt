### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions to practice your Python skills.

What is the output of the following code?
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(name + " is " + str(age))

A) Alice is 25
B) name is age
C) Alice is age
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Now let's move on.

What will this function return when called with get_total(3, 7)?
def get_total(x, y):
    return x * y + 5

A) 10
B) 26
C) 21
D) 15

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's right. Next question:

Consider this code with a recursive function. What does it return?
def mystery(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)

mystery(4)

A) 10
B) 4
C) 24
D) 1

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is C (24). This is a factorial function.

Let's continue. What does the following code output?
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = my_list[1:4]
print(result)

A) [1, 2, 3]
B) [2, 3, 4]
C) [2, 3, 4, 5]
D) [1, 2, 3, 4]

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's the next one:

What is the output of this code?
for i in range(3):
    print(i * 2)

A) 0 2 4
B) 0
2
4
C) 2 4 6
D) 1 2 3

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's right. Now a harder one:

What will this code print?
data = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
data["c"] = data.get("b") + data.get("d", 0)
print(data["c"])

A) KeyError
B) 3
C) 2
D) None

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is C (2). The .get() method returns 0 as default when "d" is not found, so 2 + 0 = 2.

Let's try another one:

What is the value of x after this code runs?
x = 10
if x > 5:
    x = x + 3
print(x)

A) 10
B) 13
C) 5
D) 8

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Last question:

What does this print?
text = "hello"
print(text[1:4])

A) hell
B) ell
C) llo
D) lo

### Human:
B
