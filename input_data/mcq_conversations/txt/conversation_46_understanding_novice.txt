### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What does the following function return?

def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

print(greet("Alice"))

A) Hello, Alice
B) greet("Alice")
C) Hello, name
D) Error: name is not defined

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function concatenates "Hello, " with the parameter value "Alice". Next question:

Consider this code:

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def bark(self):
        return self.name + " says woof"

my_dog = Dog("Buddy")
print(my_dog.bark())

What is the output?
A) Buddy
B) Buddy says woof
C) Dog says woof
D) self.name says woof

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The bark() method returns the dog's name concatenated with " says woof". Next question:

What is the output of the following code?

x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 13
B) 7
C) 103
D) 30

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will this code print?

name = "Python"
print(name + " is fun")

A) name is fun
B) Python is fun
C) name + " is fun"
D) Python + is fun

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does this code output?

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0
1
2
D) range(3)

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Which of these correctly removes the last character from a string?

text = "hello"

A) text.pop()
B) text.remove(-1)
C) text[:-1]
D) text.delete()

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The slice notation text[:-1] removes the last character. Next question:

What is the output of this recursive function?

def countdown(n):
    if n == 0:
        return "Done"
    else:
        return str(n) + " " + countdown(n - 1)

print(countdown(3))

A) 3 2 1 Done
B) 1 2 3
C) 3 Done
D) Done 1 2 3

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The recursion builds the string from 3 down to 0, resulting in "3 2 1 Done".

Consider this code with nested dictionaries:

data = {
    "users": {
        "alice": {"age": 25, "city": "NYC"},
        "bob": {"age": 30, "city": "LA"}
    }
}

What is the value of data["users"]["alice"]["city"]?

A) alice
B) NYC
C) 25
D) Error: too many subscripts

### Human:
A
