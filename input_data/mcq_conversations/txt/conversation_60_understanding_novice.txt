### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions.

What does the following function return?
```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b
result = add_numbers(5, 3)
```
What is the value of result?
A) "5 3"
B) 8
C) "8"
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function returns the sum of the two numbers. Let's move on.

Which string method converts text to uppercase?
A) .upper()
B) .uppercase()
C) .toUpper()
D) .UPPER()

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Not quite. The correct method is .upper(). Next question:

What will this code output?
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
for item in my_list:
    if item > 2:
        print(item)
```
A) 1 2 3 4
B) 3 4
C) 2 3
D) Error

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The code will print the items greater than 2. Let's try an easier one.

What is the output of this code?
```python
x = 10
y = 5
print(x - y)
```
A) 15
B) 5
C) 50
D) -5

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Now let's try something more complex.

What will this recursive function return when called with mystery(3)?
```python
def mystery(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * mystery(n - 1)
```
A) 3
B) 6
C) 9
D) 27

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function calculates a factorial. Let's continue.

Consider this code:
```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
my_dog = Dog("Buddy")
print(my_dog.name)
```
What will be printed?
A) Dog
B) __init__
C) Buddy
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Not quite. Let's try another basic one.

What is the output of the following?
```python
name = "Python"
print(name + " is fun")
```
A) Python is fun
B) Pythonisfun
C) name + " is fun"
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. One more question:

What does this code print?
```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
```
A) 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2
C) 3
D) 0 1 2 3

### Human:
B
