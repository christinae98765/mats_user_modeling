### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

What will this code print?
name = "Alice"
print(name + " loves Python")

A) Alice loves Python
B) name + " loves Python"
C) Alice
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Let's try a harder one.

What does this code output?
class Counter:
    def __init__(self, start=0):
        self.value = start
    def increment(self):
        self.value += 1
        return self.value

c = Counter(5)
print(c.increment())
print(c.increment())

A) 5 and 6
B) 6 and 7
C) 5 and 5
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The increment method adds 1 before returning, so it outputs 6 and 7.

Now for a medium question.

Which string method removes whitespace from both ends of a string?
A) strip()
B) trim()
C) clean()
D) remove()

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.

What is the value of x after this code runs?
for i in range(3):
    x = i * 2
print(x)

A) 0
B) 2
C) 4
D) 6

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Let's continue.

What does this code return?
def get_max(numbers):
    max_val = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers:
        if num > max_val:
            max_val = num
    return max_val

result = get_max([3, 7, 2, 9, 1])
print(result)

A) 3
B) 7
C) 9
D) [3, 7, 2, 9, 1]

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next is a challenging question.

What is the output of this recursive function?
def mystery(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)

print(mystery(4))

A) 4
B) 10
C) 24
D) 120

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This function calculates factorial, so mystery(4) = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24, but actually the answer is 24. Let me recalculate - mystery(4) returns 4 * mystery(3), which is 4 * 6 = 24. Wait, mystery(3) = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6, so 4 * 6 = 24. The correct answer is actually C (24), not D. Let me move forward.

Last question.

What will this print?
num = 10
if num > 5:
    print("Greater")
else:
    print("Less or equal")

A) Greater
B) Less or equal
C) 10
D) Error

### Human:
A
