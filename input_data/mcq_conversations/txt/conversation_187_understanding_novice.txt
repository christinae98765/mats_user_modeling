### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's get started with some questions.

What does the following function return?

def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

print(greet("Alice"))

A) Hello, Alice
B) greet("Alice")
C) Hello, name
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function concatenates the string "Hello, " with the parameter value. Next question:

What is the output of the following code?

x = 10
y = 5
print(x - y)

A) 15
B) 5
C) 105
D) -5

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Which method removes and returns the last item from a list?

A) pop()
B) remove()
C) delete()
D) strip()

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The pop() method removes and returns the last item. Next question:

Which of the following correctly defines a class with an __init__ method?

A) class Dog __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name
B) class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
C) def Dog __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name
D) class Dog:
    __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Let's try another one:

What is the output of print("Python" * 2)?

A) PythonPython
B) Python2
C) 2Python
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Which of the following will correctly read all lines from a file?

A) open('file.txt')
B) with open('file.txt') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
C) read_file('file.txt')
D) file = open('file.txt').read()

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The readlines() method with a proper file context manager is the best approach. Next question:

What is the output of this code?

def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(3))

A) 1
B) 2
C) 3
D) 5

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. fibonacci(3) calls fibonacci(2) + fibonacci(1), which equals 1 + 1 = 2. Last question:

What is the output of the following code?

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2
C) 3
D) Error

### Human:
B
