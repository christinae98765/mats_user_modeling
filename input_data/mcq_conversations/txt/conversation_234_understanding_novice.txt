### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions to practice your Python skills.

What does the following function return?

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

result = add(5, 3)

A) 8
B) 53
C) "5 + 3"
D) None

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds the two numbers together, so the result would be 8. Let's move on.

Consider this recursive function:

def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

What does factorial(4) return?
A) 10
B) 24
C) 4
D) 16

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The factorial of 4 is 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24. Next question:

What is the output of the following code?

x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 7
B) 13
C) 103
D) 30

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Now for a harder question:

You have a dictionary:

student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 20, "grade": "A"}

How do you access the student's grade?
A) student["A"]
B) student[grade]
C) student.grade
D) student["grade"]

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Dictionary access uses the key in quotes: student["grade"] would give you "A". Next:

What is the output of:

text = "Hello"
print(len(text))

A) "Hello"
B) 4
C) 5
D) 6

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's the next one:

Which string method converts text to uppercase?

A) text.upper()
B) text.uppercase()
C) text.UPPER()
D) text.toUpper()

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct method is text.upper(). Moving on:

What will this code output?

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 1, 2, 3
B) 0, 1, 2
C) 3
D) 0, 1, 2, 3

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The range(3) produces 0, 1, and 2. Last question:

What is the output of:

x = "Python"
print(x[0])

A) Python
B) P
C) 0
D) y

### Human:
B
