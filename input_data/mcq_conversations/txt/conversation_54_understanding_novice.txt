That's not quite right. The answer is B - the loop modifies the local variable, not the list itself. Next question:

What is the output of this recursive function?
```python
def mystery(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * mystery(n - 1)

print(mystery(4))
```
A) 4
B) 0
C) 24
D) Error
