### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions to practice your Python skills.

What will this function return?
```python
def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y
result = add_numbers(5, 3)
```
A) 8
B) 53
C) None
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Which of these correctly implements a recursive function to calculate factorial?
A) def factorial(n): return n * factorial(n-1)
B) def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1: return 1
    return n * factorial(n-1)
C) def factorial(n): return n * n
D) def factorial(n): return factorial(n) * n

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The base case is missing, which would cause infinite recursion. Next question:

What is the output of this code?
```python
name = "Python"
print(name[0])
```
A) P
B) y
C) n
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will this print?
```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
```
A) 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2
C) 3
D) 0 1 2 3

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Which method removes and returns the last element from a list?
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
```
A) my_list.remove()
B) my_list.delete()
C) my_list.pop()
D) my_list.shift()

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does this code output?
```python
data = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
data['c'] = data.get('d', 3)
print(data)
```
A) {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 1}
B) {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
C) Error: key 'd' not found
D) {'a': 1, 'b': 2}

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The .get() method returns a default value if the key doesn't exist. Next question:

Which code correctly opens a file and handles potential errors?
A) f = open('file.txt')
B) f = open('file.txt'); f.read()
C) try:
    f = open('file.txt')
    content = f.read()
finally:
    f.close()
D) with open('file.txt') as f: content = f.read()

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Options C and D both handle file operations safely, but D is the more Pythonic approach. Final question:

What will this code output?
```python
def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):
    return greeting + " " + name
print(greet("Alice", "Hi"))
```
A) Hello Alice
B) Hi Alice
C) Error: too many arguments
D) Alice Hi

### Human:
B
