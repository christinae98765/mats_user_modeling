Correct. Next question:

Which of these correctly defines a recursive function to calculate the factorial of n?

A) def factorial(n):
    return n * factorial(n-1)

B) def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n-1)

C) def factorial(n):
    return n!

D) def factorial(n):
    factorial(n-1)

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B - you need a base case to stop the recursion.
