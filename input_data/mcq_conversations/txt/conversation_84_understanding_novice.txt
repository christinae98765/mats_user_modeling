### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions to practice your Python skills.

Question 1: What will this function return?

def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

print(greet("Alice"))

A) Hello, name
B) Hello, Alice
C) greet("Alice")
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function concatenates "Hello, " with the parameter value.

Question 2: What does this recursive function return when called with factorial(4)?

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

A) 4
B) 10
C) 24
D) 16

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function multiplies all numbers from 4 down to 1.

Question 3: What will this code output?

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for i in range(len(my_list)):
    if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:
        print(my_list[i])

A) 1 3 5
B) 2 4
C) 1 2 3 4 5
D) 0 1 2 3 4

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The code prints only the even numbers.

Question 4: What is the output of this code?

x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 7
B) 13
C) 30
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct.

Question 5: What does this code print?

name = "Python"
print(name + " is fun")

A) name is fun
B) Python is fun
C) Python + is fun
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct.

Question 6: What will this if statement do?

age = 20
if age >= 18:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Minor")

A) Print "Minor"
B) Print "Adult"
C) Print nothing
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct.

Question 7: What is the output of this code?

def add_numbers(a, b):
    total = a + b
    return total

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result * 2)

A) 16
B) 10
C) 8
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds 5 and 3 to get 8, then multiplies by 2.

Question 8: Consider this dictionary and nested access:

data = {
    "users": {
        "user1": {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
    }
}

What does this return?
data["users"]["user1"]["age"]

A) "Alice"
B) 25
C) "user1"
D) Error

### Human:
A
