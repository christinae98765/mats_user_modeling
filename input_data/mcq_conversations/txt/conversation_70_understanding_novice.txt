### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions to practice your Python skills.

What will this function return?

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)

A) 8
B) 53
C) "5 3"
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds the two numbers together, so it returns 8. Let's move on.

Consider this recursive function:

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

What is factorial(4)?
A) 24
B) 10
C) 4
D) 16

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
Not quite. This recursively multiplies: 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24. Let's continue.

What does this code do?

my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
my_dict["city"] = "Boston"

A) Removes the "age" key
B) Adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary
C) Creates a syntax error
D) Converts the dictionary to a list

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The code adds a new key-value pair, so the dictionary now has three entries. Moving forward.

What is the output of this code?

x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 7
B) 13
C) 103
D) 30

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Let's continue.

What will this code print?

name = "Python"
print(name + " is great")

A) Python is great
B) Python
C) is great
D) name is great

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's the next question.

Which string method converts all characters to uppercase?

text = "hello"

A) text.upper()
B) text.uppercase()
C) text.UPPER()
D) text.to_upper()

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct method is upper(), not uppercase(). Let's try another.

What will this code output?

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def bark(self):
        return self.name + " says woof!"

dog = Dog("Rex")
print(dog.bark())

A) Dog says woof!
B) Rex says woof!
C) self.name says woof!
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The instance variable name is "Rex", so it prints "Rex says woof!".

What is the output of this code?

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0\n1\n2 (printed on separate lines)
D) 3

### Human:
C
