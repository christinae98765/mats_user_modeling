### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions to practice your Python skills.

What does the following function return?

def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)

A) 8
B) 53
C) x + y
D) None

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds the two parameters together, so it would return 8.

Now, consider this recursive function:

def countdown(n):
    if n == 0:
        return "Done"
    else:
        return countdown(n - 1)

What happens when you call countdown(3)?

A) Returns "Done" after 3 recursive calls
B) Returns 3
C) Causes an infinite loop
D) Returns "Done" immediately

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function has a base case at n == 0, so it will eventually return "Done" after 3 recursive calls.

Which string method would you use to remove leading and trailing whitespace from a string?

A) remove()
B) strip()
C) trim()
D) clean()

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct method is strip(), which removes whitespace from both ends of a string.

What is the output of the following code?

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_list.pop()
print(my_list)

A) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
B) [2, 3, 4, 5]
C) [1, 2, 3, 4]
D) []

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. The pop() method removes the last element from the list.

What will this code print?

x = 10
y = 5
print(x * y)

A) 15
B) 105
C) 50
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Multiplying 10 by 5 gives 50.

Consider this code with a dictionary:

student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "grade": "A"}
student["age"] = 26
del student["grade"]

What does student now contain?

A) {"name": "Alice", "age": 26, "grade": "A"}
B) {"name": "Alice", "age": 26}
C) {"age": 26}
D) {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. When you change student["age"] to 26 and delete "grade", the dictionary becomes {"name": "Alice", "age": 26}.

Final question: What is the output of this code?

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0\n1\n2 (each on a new line)
D) range(3)

### Human:
A
