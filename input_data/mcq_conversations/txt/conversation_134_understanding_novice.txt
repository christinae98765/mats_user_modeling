### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions to practice your Python skills.

What does the following function return?

def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

result = greet("Alice")

A) "Hello, Alice"
B) "Hello, name"
C) None
D) "Hello, "

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function concatenates "Hello, " with the parameter value passed in. Next question:

Which string method converts a string to all uppercase letters?

A) .upper()
B) .uppercase()
C) .UPPER()
D) .toUpper()

### Human:

That's not quite right. Let's try an easier one:

What is the output of the following code?

name = "Python"
print(name)

A) name
B) Python
C) "Python"
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Now let's move to a harder concept:

What will this code output?

def mystery(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * mystery(n - 1)

print(mystery(4))

A) 4
B) 10
C) 24
D) 256

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Next question:

What does this code print?

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0\n1\n2
D) 3

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's the next one:

What is the value of my_list after this code runs?

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)

A) [1, 2, 3, 4]
B) [4]
C) [1, 2, 3]
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Let's try another difficult one:

What will this code output?

my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
for key in my_dict:
    print(key)

A) 1 2
B) a b
C) {"a": 1, "b": 2}
D) KeyError

### Human:
C
