Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What will this code output?
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Sound"

dog = Animal("Rex")
print(dog.speak())
```
A) Rex
B) Sound
C) Animal
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B—the speak() method returns "Sound". Let's try another.

What does this print?
```python
x = 5
y = 3
print(x * y)
```
A) 8
B) 15
C) 53
D) 35

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the output of this code?
```python
text = "hello"
print(text.upper())
```
A) HELLO
B) Hello
C) hello
D) HeLLo

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is A—upper() converts the string to uppercase. Here's the next one:

What will print?
```python
if 10 > 5:
    print("yes")
else:
    print("no")
```
A) no
B) yes
C) 10
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the length of the list after this code runs?
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)
my_list.append(5)
print(len(my_list))
```
A) 3
B) 4
C) 5
D) 6

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is C—after appending two elements, the list has 5 items. Next question:

What will this recursive function return when called with fib(4)?
```python
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
A) 3
B) 4
C) 5
D) 2

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is A—fib(4) evaluates to 3. Here's another:

What does this print?
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(name + " is " + str(age))
```
A) name is age
B) Alice is 25
C) Alice is age
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Last question:

What will this code output?
```python
def process(items):
    result = {}
    for item in items:
        result[item[0]] = item[1]
    return result

data = [("a", 1), ("b", 2), ("c", 3)]
print(process(data)["b"])
```
A) ("b", 2)
B) 2
C) b
D) Error

### Human:
A
