### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Absolutely! I'm ready to help you practice. Let's start with question 1.

What does the following function return?

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
```

A) 8
B) "5 3"
C) None
D) 53

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Moving to question 2.

What is the output of the following code?

```python
text = "python"
print(text.upper())
```

A) python
B) PYTHON
C) Python
D) pYTHON

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.

What will this code print?

```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)
```

A) 13
B) 7
C) 30
D) 3.33

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Now for question 4.

Consider this recursive function:

```python
def mystery(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)

print(mystery(4))
```

What is the output?

A) 4
B) 10
C) 24
D) 1

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is C (24 - this calculates 4 factorial). Moving to question 5.

What will this code output?

```python
data = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}
for key in data:
    print(key)
```

A) Alice 25
B) name age
C) {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}
D) Alice

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B (it prints the keys: name and age). Next question.

What is the output of this code?

```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
```

A) 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2
C) 3
D) 0 1 2 3

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Moving to question 7.

What will this print?

```python
name = "Alice"
greeting = "Hello, " + name
print(greeting)
```

A) Hello, Alice
B) Hello, name
C) "Hello, Alice"
D) Alice Hello,

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Final question.

What does this code do?

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
filtered = [x for x in numbers if x > 2]
print(filtered)
```

A) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
B) [3, 4, 5]
C) [2, 3, 4, 5]
D) [1, 2]

### Human:
B
