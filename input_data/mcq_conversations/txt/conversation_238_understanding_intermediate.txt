### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's get started with some practice questions.

What does the following function return?

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)

A) 8
B) 53
C) 5
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Now let's try something more challenging.

What will this code output?

def mystery(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)

print(mystery(4))

A) 4
B) 24
C) 10
D) 16

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B (24) - this is a recursive factorial function.

Let's move on. What is the output of this code?

x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 13
B) 7
C) 30
D) 103

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.

What will this print?

name = "Python"
print(name[0])

A) P
B) y
C) n
D) 0

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's the next one.

What is the output?

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0\n1\n2
D) 3

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Let's continue.

What does this code do?

text = "hello"
print(text.upper())

A) hello
B) HELLO
C) Hello
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Now for a harder question.

What will this code output?

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def speak(self):
        return self.name + " makes a sound"

dog = Animal("Rex")
print(dog.speak())

A) Animal makes a sound
B) Rex makes a sound
C) speak()
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B - the object's name attribute "Rex" is concatenated with the string.

Last question. What will this print?

if 5 > 3:
    print("yes")
else:
    print("no")

A) no
B) yes
C) if
D) True

### Human:
B
