A) 13
B) 7
C) 103
D) 3

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's correct. Now for a harder one:

Consider this code with a recursive function:

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

What is factorial(4)?

A) 24
B) 4
C) 10
D) 16

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is A (24). Moving on:

What will this code output?

if 5 > 3:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")

B) Yes
C) 5 > 3
D) True

### Human:
B

### Assistant:

words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for word in words:
    print(word.upper())

A) apple banana cherry
B) APPLE\nBANANA\nCHERRY
C) APPLE BANANA CHERRY
D) ['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'CHERRY']

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's the next one:

What is the output of this code?

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

result = multiply(4, 5)
print(result)

A) 9
B) 45
C) 20
D) "4 * 5"

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's correct. Now try this challenging question:

Consider this nested dictionary and list structure:

data = {
    "users": [
        {"name": "Alice", "age": 30},
        {"name": "Bob", "age": 25}
    ]
}

What is data["users"][1]["age"]?

A) 30
B) 25
C) "Bob"
D) IndexError

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B (25). Last question:
