### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What does the following function return?

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(3, 5)

A) 8
B) "3, 5"
C) None
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function returns the sum of the two parameters. Let's move on.

Which string method would convert "hello" to "HELLO"?
A) .lower()
B) .upper()
C) .capitalize()
D) .reverse()

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. .lower() does the opposite. Try this next one.

What will this code print?

x = 5
while x > 0:
    print(x)
    x = x - 1

A) 5 4 3 2 1
B) 0
C) 5 4 3 2 1 0
D) Infinite loop

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The loop decrements x each iteration, so it will stop when x reaches 0. Next question.

What is the length of this list?

my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]

A) 3
B) 4
C) 40
D) 10

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The list has four elements. Let's try an easier one.

What is the output of print("Python" + " " + "rocks")?
A) Python rocks
B) Pythonrocks
C) "Python rocks"
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Now for a harder question.

Consider this code:

def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

What does factorial(4) return?
A) 10
B) 24
C) 4
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This is a recursive function that multiplies n by the factorial of n-1.

Which statement correctly creates a dictionary in Python?
A) my_dict = ["name": "Alice", "age": 25]
B) my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
C) my_dict = ("name": "Alice", "age": 25)
D) my_dict = <"name": "Alice", "age": 25>

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Dictionaries use curly braces. Let's finish with this one.

What is the output of this code?

x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is 5 or less")

A) x is 5 or less
B) x is greater than 5
C) Both messages print
D) No output

### Human:
B
