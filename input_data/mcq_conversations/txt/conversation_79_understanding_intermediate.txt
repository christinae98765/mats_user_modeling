Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

Correct. Next question:

What is the output of this code?

def mystery(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)

print(mystery(4))

A) 4
B) 10
C) 24
D) 120

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The recursive function calculates 4! (factorial), which is 24. Next question:
