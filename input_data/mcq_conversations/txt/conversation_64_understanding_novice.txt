### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some Python fundamentals.

What is the output of this code?
print(10 - 3)

A) 7
B) 13
C) 103
D) Error

x = "Hello"
print(x + " World")

A) Hello World
B) x + World

D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Let's move to functions.

What is the output of this code?
def add(a, b):

C) 53
D) Error

### Human:

That's not quite right. Let's try another:

What does this code return?
text = "python"
print(text.upper())

That's not quite right. The upper() method converts text to uppercase.

    print(i)

A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0
1
2
D) Error

### Human:

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Range starts at 0 by default.

What is the output of this code?
def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
print(factorial(4))

A) 10
B) 24
C) 16
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This is a recursive function.

What does this code do?
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print(my_dict.get("name"))

A) {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
B) KeyError

D) name

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The get() method returns the value associated with the key.
