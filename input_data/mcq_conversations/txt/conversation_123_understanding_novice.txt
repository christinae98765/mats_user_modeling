### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's get started with some questions to practice your Python skills.

What does the following function return?

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)

A) 8
B) 53
C) 35
D) None

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds the two numbers together, so 5 + 3 = 8.

Let's move on. What is the output of this code?

x = 10
y = 5
print(x - y)

A) 15
B) 50
C) 5
D) 105

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will this code output?

word = "hello"
print(word.upper())

A) hello
B) HELLO
C) Hello
D) ERROR

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The upper() method converts all characters to uppercase, so the output would be HELLO.

Let's try this one:

What is the output of the following code?

def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(4))

A) 2
B) 3
C) 4
D) 6

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The recursive function calculates fibonacci(4) = 3.

Here's an easier one:

What will print("Hello" + " " + "World") output?

A) Hello World
B) HelloWorld
C) Hello +  + World
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Consider this code:

my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "NYC"}
my_dict["age"] = 26
my_dict["country"] = "USA"

What is the length of my_dict?

A) 2
B) 3
C) 4
D) 5

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. After adding the "country" key, the dictionary has 4 key-value pairs.

Let's continue:

What will this loop print?

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0\n1\n2
D) 3

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The range(3) produces 0, 1, 2, which get printed on separate lines.

Final question:

What is the value of x after this code runs?

x = 7
y = 2
x = x * y
print(x)

A) 9
B) 14
C) 27
D) 72

### Human:
B
