### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

What does the following function return?

def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y

result = add_numbers(5, 3)

A) 8
B) '53'
C) 15
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds the two numbers together, so it returns 8. Let's move on.

Consider this code:

data = {'name': 'Alice', 'scores': [85, 90, 88]}
print(data['scores'][1])

What is printed?
A) Alice
B) 85
C) 90
D) [85, 90, 88]

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The code accesses the second element (index 1) of the scores list, which is 90.

What is the output of the following code?

x = 10
print(x * 2)

A) 10
B) 20
C) 102
D) x * 2

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct.

What will this code print?

name = 'Python'
print(name[0])

A) Python
B) 0
C) P
D) n

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct.

What is the result of this code?

if 5 > 3:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')

A) No
B) Yes
C) 5 > 3
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct.

What does this code output?

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2 3
C) 0\n1\n2
D) 3

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct.

What is the output of this code?

text = 'hello'
print(text.upper())

A) hello
B) HELLO
C) Hello
D) HELLO()

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The upper() method converts the string to uppercase, so the output is HELLO.

What does this recursive function return when called with n=3?

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

A) 3
B) 6
C) 9
D) Error

### Human:
A
