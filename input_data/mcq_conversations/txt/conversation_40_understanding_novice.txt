### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What is the output of this code?
print(5 * 2)

A) 10
B) 52
C) 7
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Let's move on.

What will this code output?
print("Hello" + " " + "World")

A) Hello World
B) "Hello World"
C) HelloWorld
D) Hello + + World

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is A - string concatenation produces Hello World without extra quotes.

Now, what does this recursive function return when called with recurse(3)?
def recurse(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * recurse(n - 1)

A) 3
B) 6
C) 9
D) 0

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This calculates a factorial, so recurse(3) returns 6.

Which code correctly creates a class and instantiates an object?

A) class Dog
    def bark():
        print("Woof")
B) class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    d = Dog("Buddy")
C) class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
d = Dog("Buddy")
D) Dog = class:
    def bark(): print("Woof")

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Option C is correct - instantiation happens outside the class definition.

What does this code output?
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(my_list[2])

A) 2
B) 3
C) 4
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Lists are zero-indexed, so my_list[2] is 3.

Which of these correctly reads a file?

A) f = open("data.txt")
    content = f.read()
    f.close()
B) content = read("data.txt")
C) f = open("data.txt", "write")
    content = f.read()
D) file = File("data.txt")
    content = file.data()

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Option A is correct - you open the file, read it, and close it properly.

What is the output of this code?
for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2
C) 3
D) 0 1 2 3

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Moving on.

What does this function return when called as result = add(10, 5)?
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

A) 15
B) "10 5"
C) (10, 5)
D) None

### Human:
D
