### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What does the following function return?

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)

What is the value of result?
A) 8
B) 53
C) Error
D) None

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds the two parameters together, so 5 + 3 = 8.

Next question: What is the output of this code?

x = 10
print(x * 2)

A) 20
B) 102
C) 12
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question: What will this code print?

name = "Alice"
print("Hello, " + name)

A) Hello, Alice name
B) Hello, Alice
C) name
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question: Consider this recursive function:

def mystery(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)

What does mystery(4) return?
A) 4
B) 10
C) 24
D) 16

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function multiplies n by the result of mystery(n-1), so mystery(4) = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24.

Next question: What is the output of this code?

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0\n1\n2
D) 3

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The range(3) produces 0, 1, 2, and each print statement puts the number on a new line, so it prints each on separate lines: 0, then 1, then 2.

Next question: Which of these correctly creates a dictionary in Python?

A) dict = ["name": "John", "age": 25]
B) dict = {"name": "John", "age": 25}
C) dict = ("name": "John", "age": 25)
D) dict = <"name": "John", "age": 25>

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Dictionaries use curly braces {}. The correct syntax is option B.

Next question: What will this code output?

text = "python"
print(text.upper())

A) python
B) PYTHON
C) Python
D) pYTHON

### Human:
D
