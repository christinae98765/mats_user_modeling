### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions to practice your Python skills.

Question 1: What does the following function return?

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
```

A) 8
B) 53
C) ab
D) None

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds the two numbers together, so 5 + 3 equals 8. Let's move on.

Question 2: Which string method removes whitespace from both ends of a string?

```python
text = "  hello  "
result = text.????()
```

A) remove()
B) strip()
C) clean()
D) trim()

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct method is strip(). Now let's try a harder concept.

Question 3: What will this code output?

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(4))
```

A) 24
B) 4
C) 0
D) 1

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This is a recursive function that calculates 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24.

Question 4: What is the output of this code?

```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)
```

A) 13
B) 7
C) 30
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Moving on.

Question 5: What will print("hello" + " " + "world") output?

A) hello world
B) helloworld
C) "hello world"
D) hello + world

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Now for a more complex question.

Question 6: What will this code output?

```python
students = {"Alice": 85, "Bob": 92, "Charlie": 78}
print(students["Bob"])
```

A) Bob
B) 92
C) Alice
D) KeyError

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. When you access a dictionary with a key like students["Bob"], it returns the value associated with that key, which is 92.

Question 7: What does this code print?

```python
if 5 > 3:
    print("yes")
else:
    print("no")
```

A) no
B) yes
C) 5 > 3
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Last question.

Question 8: What will this while loop print?

```python
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print(count)
    count = count + 1
```

A) 0 1 2 3
B) 0
C) 1 2 3
D) 0 1 2

### Human:
A
