### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

What does this function return?
```python
def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y
result = add_numbers(5, 3)
```
A) 8
B) 53
C) None
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function returns the sum of the two numbers, which is 8. Let's move on.

What is the output of this code?
```python
text = "hello"
print(text.upper())
```
A) HELLO
B) hello
C) Hello
D) ERROR

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The upper() method converts the string to uppercase, so the output is HELLO.

Consider this code with a dictionary:
```python
student = {"name": "Alex", "age": 20, "grade": "A"}
print(student["name"])
```
What is printed?
A) {"name": "Alex", "age": 20, "grade": "A"}
B) Alex
C) name
D) KeyError

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Accessing student["name"] retrieves the value associated with the "name" key, which is "Alex".

What will this code output?
```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
```
A) 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2
C) 3
D) 0 1 2 3

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct.

What is the output of the following code?
```python
x = 10
y = 5
print(x - y)
```
A) 15
B) 5
C) 105
D) 50

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct.

What does this code print?
```python
name = "Python"
print("Hello, " + name)
```
A) Hello, name
B) name
C) Hello, Python
D) HelloPython

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct.

Consider this recursive function:
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
print(factorial(4))
```
What is the output?
A) 4
B) 24
C) 16
D) 1

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function calculates 4 × 3 × 2 × 1, which equals 24.

What will this code do?
```python
with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
print(lines[0])
```
A) Prints the entire file contents
B) Prints the first line of the file
C) Creates a new file
D) Prints the file name

### Human:
D
