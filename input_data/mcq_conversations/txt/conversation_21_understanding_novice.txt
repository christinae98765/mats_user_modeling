### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What will this function return?

def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y

result = add_numbers(5, 3)

A) 8
B) 53
C) x + y
D) Nothing

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds the values together, so 5 + 3 equals 8. Let's move on.

What does this code output?

x = 10
print(x * 2)

A) 102
B) 20
C) x * 2
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the result of this code?

name = "Python"
print(name[0])

A) P
B) y
C) Python
D) 0

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Which method removes whitespace from the beginning and end of a string?

A) strip()
B) remove()
C) trim()
D) clean()

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct method is strip(). Let's continue.

What does this code do?

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) Prints 0, 1, 2
B) Prints 1, 2, 3
C) Prints 3
D) Creates a list of 3 items

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. range(3) produces 0, 1, 2, so the loop prints those values on separate lines. Next question:

What is the length of this list?

my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]
print(len(my_list))

A) 4
B) 10
C) 40
D) 100

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will this recursive function return when called with factorial(4)?

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

A) 10
B) 24
C) 16
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The factorial of 4 is 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24. Final question:

What does this code print?

data = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print(data["name"])

A) name
B) Alice
C) 25
D) Error

### Human:
C
