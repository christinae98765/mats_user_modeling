### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions to test your skills.

What does the following function return?

def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

print(greet("Alice"))

A) Hello, Alice
B) Hello,Alice
C) "Hello, Alice"
D) name

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct answer is A - string concatenation adds the strings together with the space included.

Here's an easier one: What is the output of this code?

x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 7
B) 13
C) 103
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Now let's try something more complex.

What will this code print?

def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(4))

A) 4
B) 24
C) 10
D) 1

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B - the function recursively calculates 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.

Consider this code with a dictionary:

student = {"name": "Bob", "grade": 85, "major": "CS"}
print(student["age"])

What happens?

A) Prints "Bob"
B) Prints 85
C) Returns KeyError
D) Prints None

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is C - accessing a key that doesn't exist in a dictionary raises a KeyError.

What is the output of this code?

words = ["cat", "dog", "bird"]
result = " ".join(words)
print(result)

A) catdogbird
B) cat dog bird
C) ["cat", "dog", "bird"]
D) cat, dog, bird

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B - the join() method combines list elements with the specified separator (a space in this case).

What will this code output?

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return self.name + " makes a sound"

dog = Animal("Rex")
print(dog.speak())

A) Animal makes a sound
B) Rex makes a sound
C) None
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B - the speak() method returns "Rex makes a sound" because the object's name attribute is "Rex".

What is the output of this code?

num = 5
print(num * 2)

A) 10
B) 52
C) 25
D) 7

### Human:
A
