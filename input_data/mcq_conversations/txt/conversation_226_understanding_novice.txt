### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some Python questions.

What will this code print?
print("Hello" + " World")

A) Hello World
B) HelloWorld
C) Hello + World
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct.

Now for the next question: What does this recursive function return when called with factorial(4)?

def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

A) 4
B) 24
C) 16
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B (24). Recursion multiplies all numbers down to 1.

Next question: What will this code output?

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit.upper())

A) apple banana cherry
B) APPLE BANANA CHERRY (each on separate lines)
C) ['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'CHERRY']
D) Error

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B. The loop prints each fruit in uppercase on separate lines.

Next question: What is the output of this code?

my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
my_dict["age"] = 26
print(my_dict["age"])

A) 25
B) 26
C) {"age": 26}
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B (26). The dictionary value was updated to 26 before printing.

Next question: What will this function return?

def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):
    return greeting + ", " + name

greet("Bob")

A) Hello, Bob
B) greet, Bob
C) Error
D) Bob, Hello

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is A. Functions with default parameters work fine when you only provide some arguments.

Next question: How many times will this loop execute?

count = 0
while count < 5:
    count += 2

A) 5 times
B) 2 times
C) 3 times
D) Infinite loop

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is C. Starting at 0, count becomes 2, 4, 6 - it stops when 6 is not less than 5, so that's 3 iterations.

Next question: What does this code do?

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def bark(self):
        return self.name + " says woof!"

my_dog = Dog("Rex")
my_dog.bark()

A) Prints "Rex says woof!"
B) Returns the string "Rex says woof!"
C) Creates a Dog class
D) Error because Dog is not defined

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B. The method returns a string but doesn't print it automatically.

Last question: What is the value of x after this code runs?

x = 10
y = 5
x = x - y
print(x)

A) 15
B) 5
C) 10
D) Error

### Human:
B
