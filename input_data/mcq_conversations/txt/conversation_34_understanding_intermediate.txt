### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's get started with some practice questions.

Question 1: What will this code output?
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} makes a sound"

dog = Animal("Rex")
print(dog.speak())
```
A) Rex
B) Rex makes a sound
C) Animal makes a sound
D) Error: speak is not defined

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The method returns the full string with both the name and the message.

Question 2: What does this code output?
```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x % y)
```
A) 3
B) 1
C) 13
D) 3.33

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question: What will this recursive function return when called with fibonacci(5)?
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
A) 3
B) 5
C) 8
D) 13

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. fibonacci(5) follows the sequence where each number is the sum of the two before it.

```python
word = "Python"
print(word[0:3])
```
A) Pyt
B) yth
C) Py
