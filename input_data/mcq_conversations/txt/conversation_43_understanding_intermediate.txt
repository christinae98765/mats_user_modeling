Consider this recursive function. What does count_down(3) output?

def count_down(n):
    if n == 0:
        return "Done"
    print(n)
    return count_down(n - 1)

That's not quite right. The function prints each number on a separate line before returning.

A) 30
B) age + 5
C) "age": 30
D) Error

That's not quite right. The code would output the number 30 since it accesses the value.
