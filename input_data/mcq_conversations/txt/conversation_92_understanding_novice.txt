### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

What will this code output?

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

d = Dog("Max")
print(d.speak())
```

A) Sound
B) Woof
C) Max
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The Dog class overrides the speak() method, so it returns "Woof" instead of "Sound".

Next question: What does the following code return?

```python
def add_suffix(word):
    return word + "ing"

result = add_suffix("walk")
print(result)
```

A) walk
B) ing
C) walking
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function concatenates "ing" to the end of "walk", resulting in "walking".

Next question: What will this code print?

```python
my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]
my_list.append(50)
print(len(my_list))
```

A) 4
B) 5
C) [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
D) 50

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. After appending 50 to the list, it has 5 elements, so len(my_list) returns 5.

Next question: Which string method removes leading and trailing whitespace?

```python
text = "  hello  "
result = text.????()
print(result)
```

A) remove()
B) clean()
C) strip()
D) trim()

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct method is strip(), which removes whitespace from both ends of a string.

Next question: What will this code output?

```python
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

A) 0 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2
C) 1 2 3
D) 3

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The loop prints 0, then 1, then 2 (when count reaches 3, the condition becomes false and the loop stops).

Next question: What will this recursive function return?

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(4))
```

A) 4
B) 24
C) 10
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. factorial(4) calculates 4 × 3 × 2 × 1, which equals 24.

Next question: What is the output of this code?

```python
x = 5
y = 3
print(x + y)
```

A) 53
B) 8
C) xy
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question: What will this print?

```python
name = "Alice"
print("Hello, " + name)
```

A) Hello, name
B) name
C) Hello, Alice
D) Error

### Human:
C
