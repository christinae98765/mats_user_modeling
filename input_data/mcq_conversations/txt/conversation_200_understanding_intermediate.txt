### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What is the output of the following code?
name = "Alice"
print(name + " loves Python")

A) Alice loves Python
B) name + " loves Python"
C) Alice
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Now let's try a harder one.

Consider this code:
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def bark(self):
        return self.name + " says woof"

my_dog = Dog("Rex")
result = my_dog.bark()
print(result)

What is printed?
A) Dog says woof
B) Rex says woof
C) self.name says woof
D) None

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct answer is B - the object stores "Rex" as the name attribute.

Let's move on to the next question.

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = [x * 2 for x in numbers if x > 2]
print(result)

A) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
B) [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
C) [6, 8, 10]
D) [3, 4, 5]

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.

What is the output of this code?

C) Sam, Hi
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
