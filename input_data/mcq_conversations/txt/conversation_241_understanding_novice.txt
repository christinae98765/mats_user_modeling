### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

What will this recursive function return when called with fibonacci(4)?

def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

A) 2
B) 3
C) 4
D) 5

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B) 3. Recursion can be tricky to trace through. Let's move on.

Consider this code with a dictionary. What will be printed?

student = {'name': 'Alice', 'grades': [85, 90, 78]}
student['grades'][1] = 95
print(student['grades'])

A) [85, 90, 78]
B) [85, 95, 78]
C) [95, 90, 78]
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B) [85, 95, 78]. When you modify a list element, that change is reflected in the dictionary. Next question.

What does the following code output?

words = ['hello', 'world', 'python']
result = [w.upper() for w in words]
print(result)

A) ['HELLO', 'WORLD', 'PYTHON']
B) ['hello', 'world', 'python']
C) 'HELLO WORLD PYTHON'
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is A) ['HELLO', 'WORLD', 'PYTHON']. The upper() method converts strings to uppercase. Here's an easier question.

What does this code print?

x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 13
B) 7
C) 30
D) 103

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Moving on.

What is the output of this code?

def get_length(text):
    return len(text)

result = get_length('hello')
print(result)

A) h
B) 4
C) 5
D) hello

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is C) 5. The len() function counts the number of characters in a string.

What is the output of this code?

name = 'Python'
print(name + ' rocks')

A) Python rocks
B) Pythonrocks
C) Python + rocks
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct.

What will this code print?

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2 3
C) 0\n1\n2
D) 3

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Now for a harder question.

What will this code output?

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} makes a sound"

dog = Animal('Rex')
print(dog.speak())

A) Animal makes a sound
B) Rex makes a sound
C) name makes a sound
D) Error: speak() is not defined

### Human:
D
