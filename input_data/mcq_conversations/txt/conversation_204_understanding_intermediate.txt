### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions to practice your Python skills.

What will this code output?
print('Hello' + ' ' + 'World')
A) Hello World
B) Hello + + World
C) Error
D) HelloWorld

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Now let's try something more challenging.

Consider this recursive function:
def count_down(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    return n + count_down(n - 1)

What does count_down(4) return?
A) 10
B) 9
C) 8
D) 11

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function sums values from 4 down to 0, which equals 10... actually, that is correct. Let me clarify - it returns 10 by adding 4+3+2+1+0.

Let's move on. What will this code do?
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def bark(self):
        return self.name + ' says woof'

dog = Dog('Rex')
print(dog.bark())

A) Rex
B) Rex says woof
C) Error: name not defined
D) Dog says woof

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The code actually runs correctly and outputs 'Rex says woof'. The self.name variable is properly defined in the __init__ method.

Here's the next question. What does this function return?
def process_list(items):
    result = []
    for item in items:
        result.append(item * 2)
    return result

process_list([1, 2, 3])
A) [1, 2, 3]
B) [2, 4, 6]
C) 6
D) [[1, 2, 3]]

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Now for the next one.

What will this code output?
text = 'Python'
print(text.lower().replace('p', 'P'))
A) python
B) Python
C) Python
D) PYTHON

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Let's continue.

What is the value of x after this code runs?
x = 10
if x > 5:
    x = x + 5
else:
    x = x - 5
A) 5
B) 10
C) 15
D) 20

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.

What does this code output?
def combine(a, b=10):
    return a + b

print(combine(5))
A) 5
B) 10
C) 15
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Last question.

What will this print?
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0\n1\n2
D) 3

### Human:
C
