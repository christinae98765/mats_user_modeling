### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions to practice your Python skills.

What does the following function return?

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)

A) 8
B) "5 3"
C) 53
D) None

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds the two numbers together. Let's move on.

What is the output of this code?

x = 10
print(x * 2)

A) 10 * 2
B) 20
C) 102
D) 12

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will this code print?

name = "Python"
print(name + " is fun")

A) Python is fun
B) Python + is fun
C) name is fun
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's a harder one:

What does this recursive function return when called with countdown(3)?

def countdown(n):
    if n == 0:
        return "Done"
    else:
        return countdown(n - 1)

A) "Done"
B) 3
C) Error
D) None

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Let's try another one:

Given this class definition, what is the value of obj.x?

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.x = value * 2

obj = MyClass(5)

A) 5
B) 10
C) 25
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The __init__ method sets x to value * 2, which would be 10.

What is the output of this code?

words = ["hello", "world"]
sentence = " ".join(words)
print(sentence)

A) ["hello", "world"]
B) hello world
C) hello" "world
D) Error

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The join() method combines the list elements with a space between them.

Consider this nested dictionary:

data = {"user": {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}}

What does data["user"]["name"] return?

A) "user"
B) {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
C) "Alice"
D) KeyError

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. You need to access the nested "name" key.

What is the output of this code?

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2
C) 3
D) 0 1 2 3

### Human:
B
