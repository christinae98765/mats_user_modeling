### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions.

Consider this code:
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

d = Dog("Rex")
print(d.speak())
```
What is printed?
A) Some sound
B) Woof
C) Rex
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The Dog class overrides the speak method, so it returns "Woof" instead of the parent's implementation.

Here's the next question:

What does this recursive function return when called with fib(5)?
```python
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
A) 3
B) 5
C) 8
D) 13

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function calculates the 5th Fibonacci number, which is 5 (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5). Wait, actually that is 5. Let me reconsider—fib(5) returns 5, so A is actually correct here.

Let's move on. What is the output of this code?
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = [x * 2 for x in my_list if x > 2]
print(result)
```
A) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
B) [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
C) [6, 8, 10]
D) [3, 4, 5]

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. The list comprehension filters for values greater than 2 and doubles them.

What will this code output?
```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("Greater")
else:
    print("Lesser")
```
A) Lesser
B) Greater
C) Error
D) Nothing

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Since 10 is greater than 5, the if condition is true.

What does this code output?
```python
def add_items(lst, item):
    lst.append(item)
    return lst

my_list = [1, 2]
result = add_items(my_list, 3)
print(len(result))
```
A) 2
B) 3
C) [1, 2, 3]
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. The function appends 3 to the list, making its length 3.

What is the output of this code?
```python
text = "Python"
print(text.lower().replace("p", "j"))
```
A) Python
B) jython
C) JYTHON
D) python

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. The string is converted to lowercase and "p" is replaced with "j".

What will x equal after this code runs?
```python
x = 5
x = x + 10
x = x * 2
print(x)
```
A) 15
B) 20
C) 30
D) 60

### Human:
C
