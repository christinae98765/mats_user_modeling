### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions to test your Python knowledge.

What does the following function return?

def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

result = greet("Alice")

A) Hello, Alice
B) Hello, name
C) "Hello, " + "Alice"
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function concatenates the strings and returns the result. Let's move on.

Consider this recursive function:

def mystery(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * mystery(n - 1)

What does mystery(4) return?
A) 4
B) 24
C) 16
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Let's try an easier one.

What is the output of the following code?

x = 10
y = 5
print(x - y)

A) 15
B) 5
C) 50
D) 105

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will be printed when this code runs?

data = {"name": "Bob", "age": 25, "city": "NYC"}
for key in data:
    print(key)

A) Bob 25 NYC
B) name age city
C) {"name": "Bob", "age": 25, "city": "NYC"}
D) name\nage\ncity

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. When iterating over a dictionary with a for loop, you get the keys in order.

What is the output of this code?

word = "Python"
print(len(word))

A) 6
B) Python
C) 7
D) 5

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Which of the following correctly calls a function that takes two parameters and returns their product?

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

A) multiply()
B) multiply(3, 4, 5)
C) multiply(3, 4)
D) return multiply(3, 4)

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Let's move on.

What will this code output?

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def bark(self):
        return self.name + " says woof!"

my_dog = Dog("Buddy")
print(my_dog.bark())

A) Dog says woof!
B) Buddy says woof!
C) name says woof!
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The name attribute is set to "Buddy" when the object is created.

What does this code print?

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0\n1\n2
D) 3

### Human:
C
