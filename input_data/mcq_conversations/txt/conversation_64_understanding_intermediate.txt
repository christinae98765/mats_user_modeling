### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

What does the following function return?

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(7, 3)

What is the value of result?
A) 10
B) 73
C) "73"
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Moving on to the next question.

Consider this code:

my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}
my_dict['age'] += 5
my_dict['city'] = 'NYC'

What is the value of my_dict after this code executes?
A) {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'NYC'}
B) {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'city': 'NYC'}
C) {'name': 'Alice', 'age': '30', 'city': 'NYC'}
D) KeyError is raised

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is A - the age is incremented to 30.

Let's continue. What is the output of this code?

x = 5
y = 3
print(x * y)

A) 8
B) 15
C) 53
D) 35

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.

What does the following code output?

text = "Python"
print(text.lower())

A) python
B) PYTHON
C) Python
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.

What will this code print?

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(num)

A) 1 3 5
B) 2 4
C) 1 2 3 4 5
D) 2\n4 (each on a new line)

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
Correct. Moving on.

What is the output of the following code?

def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

message = greet("Bob")
print(message)

A) "Hello, Bob"
B) Hello, Bob
C) greet("Bob")
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.

Consider this recursive function:

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

What is factorial(4)?
A) 10
B) 24
C) 16
D) 4

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B - 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24.

Final question. What is the output of this code?

name = "Alice"
age = 30
print(name + " is " + str(age))

A) Alice is 30
B) Alice is age
C) Error
D) name + " is " + str(age)

### Human:
