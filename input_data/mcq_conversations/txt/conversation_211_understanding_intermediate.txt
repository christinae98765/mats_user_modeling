### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! I'd be happy to help you practice Python. Let's get started with our first question.

What does the following function return?

def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y

result = add_numbers(5, 3)

A) 8
B) "5 3"
C) 53
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Moving on to the next question.

Which string method removes leading and trailing whitespace?

A) strip()
B) trim()
C) clean()
D) remove()

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's the next question.

What will this code output?

x = 10
y = 20
print(x + y)

A) "10 20"
B) 30
C) 1020
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Let's try a harder one now.

What is the output of the following code?

def countdown(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return n + countdown(n - 1)

print(countdown(3))

A) 3
B) 0
C) 6
D) 1

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function uses recursion to sum all numbers from 3 down to 0, which gives 6.

Consider this code with a dictionary:

student = {"name": "Alex", "age": 20, "grade": "A"}
student["age"] = 21

What is the value of student["age"] after these lines execute?

A) 20
B) "20"
C) 21
D) KeyError

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. When we assign a value to a dictionary key with student["age"] = 21, the value becomes 21 as an integer.

What is the output of this code?

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2
C) 3
D) 0 1 2 3

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's another challenging question.

Which of these correctly defines a class and creates an instance?

A) class Dog
     def __init__(self, name):
         self.name = name
   dog = Dog("Max")

B) class Dog:
     def __init__(self, name):
         self.name = name
   dog = Dog("Max")

C) Dog = class:
     def __init__(self, name):
         self.name = name
   dog = Dog("Max")

D) class Dog():
     name = "Max"
   dog = Dog

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Class definitions in Python require a colon after the class name, and the correct syntax is shown in option B.

What does this code print?

text = "hello"
print(text.upper())

A) hello
B) HELLO
C) Hello
D) hELLO

### Human:
B
