### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start practicing.

What does the following function return?

def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

greet("Alice")

A) "Hello, Alice"
B) "Hello, name"
C) None
D) "greet"

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function concatenates the string "Hello, " with the parameter value passed in. Let's move on.

Which method removes spaces from both ends of a string?

A) trim()
B) strip()
C) clean()
D) remove()

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct method in Python is strip(). Moving on.

What is the output of this code?

x = 10
y = 5
print(x - y)

A) 15
B) 5
C) 10
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.

What will this code print?

if 7 > 5:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")

A) No
B) 7 > 5
C) Yes
D) Nothing

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Now let's try something more complex.

What is the value of my_dict["age"] after this code runs?

my_dict = {"name": "Bob", "age": 25}
my_dict["age"] += 5

A) 25
B) 30
C) "age"
D) KeyError

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The += operator adds 5 to the current value. Moving on.

What is the output of this recursive function call?

def countdown(n):
    if n == 0:
        return "Done"
    return countdown(n - 1)

countdown(2)

A) "Done"
B) 2
C) None
D) Infinite recursion

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function will eventually reach the base case where n == 0 and return "Done". Let's continue.

Consider this class definition. What will print when you create an instance?

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

my_dog = Dog("Buddy")
print(my_dog.name)

A) name
B) Dog
C) Buddy
D) None

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The __init__ method sets the name attribute, so accessing my_dog.name returns "Buddy". Here's the final question.

What does this code output?

try:
    x = 10 / 0
    print("Success")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error caught")

A) Success
B) Error caught
C) ZeroDivisionError
D) None

### Human:
A
