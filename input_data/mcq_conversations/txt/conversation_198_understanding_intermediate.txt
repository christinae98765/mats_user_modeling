### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions.

What will this code print?

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

d = Dog("Rex")
print(d.speak())
```

A) Sound
B) Woof
C) Rex
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The Dog class overrides the speak() method, so it returns "Woof".

Next question: What will this code output?

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(my_list[1:4])
```

A) [1, 2, 3]
B) [2, 3, 4]
C) [2, 3, 4, 5]
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. List slicing [1:4] includes index 1 up to but not including index 4.

What does the following code do?

```python
text = "hello"
print(text.upper())
```

A) hello
B) HELLO
C) Hello
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. The upper() method converts all characters to uppercase.

What will this code output?

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(3, 5)
print(result)
```

A) 3
B) 5
C) 8
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. The function returns the sum of the two arguments.

Consider this recursive function. What will it return?

```python
def mystery(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)

print(mystery(5))
```

A) 5
B) 120
C) 15
D) 1

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This is a factorial function that multiplies all numbers from 5 down to 1, which equals 120.

What is the output of this code?

```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)
```

A) 13
B) 7
C) 30
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. 10 minus 3 equals 7.

What will this print?

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(name + " is " + str(age))
```

A) Alice is 25
B) Alice is age
C) Error
D) Alice25

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. String concatenation combines the strings and the converted age value.

What is the output of this code?

```python
my_dict = {"name": "Bob", "age": 30}
for key in my_dict:
    print(key)
```

A) Bob 30
B) name age
C) "name" "age"
D) Bob

### Human:
B
