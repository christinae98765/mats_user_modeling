### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's get started with some practice questions.

Consider this code:
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

d = Dog("Rex")
print(d.speak())
```
What is the output?
A) Some sound
B) Woof
C) Rex
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The Dog class overrides the speak method, so it returns "Woof".

Next question: What does the .upper() method do to a string?
A) Converts it to a list
B) Removes spaces from the string
C) Converts all characters to uppercase
D) Reverses the string

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Now for the next question:

What will this code output?
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[1])
```
A) apple
B) banana
C) cherry
D) IndexError

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Moving on:

What is the value of x after this code runs?
```python
x = 10
x = x + 5
```
A) 10
B) 15
C) 5
D) 105

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does this code print?
```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
```
A) 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2 3
C) 0\n1\n2
D) 3

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. range(3) produces 0, 1, 2, and each print outputs on a new line, but the answer would be displayed as 0 1 2 vertically, not with escaped \n. Let me continue.

Consider this recursive function:
```python
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

print(fib(5))
```
What is the output?
A) 3
B) 4
C) 5
D) 8

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. fib(5) returns 5, not 8.

Last question: What will this print?
```python
name = "Python"
print(name[0])
```
A) P
B) Python
C) 0
D) y

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. That's the end of the practice questions. Thank you for working through these!

What will this code output?
```python
if 5 > 3:
    print("yes")
else:
    print("no")
```
A) no
B) yes
C) 5 > 3
D) Error

### Human:
B
