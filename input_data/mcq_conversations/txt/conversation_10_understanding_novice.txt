### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What does the following function return?

def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)

A) 53
B) 8
C) 35
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds the parameters together. Next question:

What is the output of this code?

name = "Python"
print(name)

A) name
B) Python
C) "Python"
D) NameError

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Which of the following correctly creates a dictionary and accesses a value?

A) my_dict = ["name": "Alice"]; print(my_dict["name"])
B) my_dict = {"name": "Alice"}; print(my_dict.get("age"))
C) my_dict = {"name": "Alice"}; print(my_dict["name"])
D) my_dict = ("name": "Alice"); print(my_dict[0])

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Let me ask the next question:

What is the output of this recursive function?

def countdown(n):
    if n == 0:
        return "Done"
    else:
        return countdown(n - 1)

print(countdown(3))

A) 3 2 1 0
B) Done
C) 3
D) RecursionError

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function returns "Done" after the recursion completes. Next question:

What is the output of this code?

x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 13
B) 7
C) 30
D) 103

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Which code correctly reads a file and stores its content?

A) file_content = open("data.txt").read()
B) file_content = read("data.txt")
C) with open("data.txt") as f: file_content = f
D) file_content = open("data.txt", "write").read()

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The variable f is the file object, not the content. Next question:

What will this code output?

words = ["hello", "world"]
for word in words:
    print(word.upper())

A) HELLO WORLD
B) HELLOWORLD
C) hello world (each on new line)
D) HELLO\nWORLD

### Human:
A
