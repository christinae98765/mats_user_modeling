### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What does the following function return?

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)

What is the value of result?
A) "5, 3"
B) 8
C) 53
D) The function returns nothing

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds the two parameters together, so 5 + 3 equals 8.

Let's try another one. What will this code print?

text = "hello"
print(text.upper())

A) hello
B) HELLO
C) Hello
D) ERROR

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The .upper() method converts all characters to uppercase.

What is the output of this code?

x = 10
y = 20
print(x + y)

A) xy
B) 1020
C) 30
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Now let's try this one.

Which of the following will add an element to a list?

my_list = [1, 2, 3]

A) my_list.add(4)
B) my_list.append(4)
C) my_list.insert(4)
D) my_list.push(4)

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct method is .append(). The .add() method is used for sets, not lists.

What is the output of this code?

print("Python" + " " + "rocks")

A) Python rocks
B) Pythonrocks
C) Python + rocks
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will this loop print?

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2 3
C) 0 1 2
D) 3

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Let's move to a harder question.

What will this code output?

my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
my_dict["age"] = 26
print(my_dict.get("age"))

A) 25
B) 26
C) "age"
D) None

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The value was updated to 26 with the assignment, so .get("age") returns 26.

Final question: What will this recursive function return when called with fact(4)?

def fact(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * fact(n - 1)

A) 4
B) 10
C) 24
D) 24

### Human:
B
