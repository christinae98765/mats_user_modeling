### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some fundamentals.

What will this code print?
x = 10
print(x * 2)

A) 10
B) 20
C) x * 2
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Moving on to the next question.

What is the output of the following?
name = "Alice"
print(name + " is here")

A) Alice is here
B) name + " is here"
C) Alice
D) name is here

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Let's increase the difficulty.

What does this code return?
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)

A) 53
B) 8
C) 5, 3
D) None

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds the parameters together.

What will be the output of this code?
my_dict = {"name": "Bob", "age": 25}
my_dict["age"] = 26
print(my_dict["age"])

A) name
B) 25
C) 26
D) {"name": "Bob", "age": 26}

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The value was updated before printing.

Which method removes whitespace from both ends of a string?
text = "  hello  "

A) text.remove()
B) text.strip()
C) text.clean()
D) text.trim()

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The strip() method is what you need.

What is the output of this recursive function?
def countdown(n):
    if n == 0:
        return "Done"
    return countdown(n - 1)

print(countdown(3))

A) 3 2 1 Done
B) Done
C) Error
D) None

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This code will actually return "Done" without errors.

Which of these will cause an error when trying to access a key in a dictionary?
my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2}

A) my_dict.get("c")
B) my_dict["c"]
C) if "c" in my_dict
D) my_dict.keys()

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Using bracket notation with a nonexistent key causes an error, while .get() returns None safely.

What will this code output?
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for i in range(len(my_list)):
    if my_list[i] > 3:
        print(my_list[i])

A) 1 2 3
B) 4 5
C) 4\n5
D) [4, 5]

### Human:
D
