### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

Of course! Let's start with a question.

What is the output of this code?
x = 10
y = 3
print(x + y)

A) 13
B) 103

D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Moving on.

What will be printed?
name = "Python"
print(name + " is fun")

B) Python is fun
C) Python + is fun
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.

What does this function return?
def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

result = multiply(4, 5)
print(result)

A) 45
B) 20
C) Error
D) 9

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's the next one.

What is the output?
for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 0 1 2 (on one line)
B) 0, 1, 2
C) 0\n1\n2 (on separate lines)
D) 1 2 3

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Now for a harder question.

What does this code output?
def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(4))

A) 4
B) 10
C) 24
D) 16

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The factorial of 4 is 24 (4 × 3 × 2 × 1).

Next question.
