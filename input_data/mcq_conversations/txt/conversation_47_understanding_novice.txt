### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

What does the following function return?

def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)

A) 8
B) 53
C) x + y
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds the values together, so it would return 8. Let's move on.

Which string method would convert 'hello' to 'HELLO'?

A) .lower()
B) .uppercase()
C) .upper()
D) .capitalize()

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
Not quite. The .upper() method converts all characters to uppercase. Let's continue.

What is the output of this code?

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for i in range(len(my_list)):
    my_list[i] = my_list[i] * 2

print(my_list)

A) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
B) [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
C) Error
D) None

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The loop multiplies each element by 2, resulting in [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]. Here's an easier question:

What is the output of this code?

x = 10
y = 5
print(x - y)

A) 5
B) 15
C) 50
D) 105

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Consider this code with a dictionary:

def modify_dict(d):
    d['new_key'] = 'new_value'
    return d

my_dict = {'a': 1}
modify_dict(my_dict)
print(my_dict)

What is printed?

A) {'a': 1}
B) {'a': 1, 'new_key': 'new_value'}
C) {'new_key': 'new_value'}
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Dictionaries are mutable, so the modification persists and the output would be {'a': 1, 'new_key': 'new_value'}. Here's another one:

What does this code print?

name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(name + " is " + str(age))

A) name is age
B) Alice is 25
C) Alice is 25.0
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What would this recursive function return for fib(4)?

def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

A) 3
B) 4
C) 5
D) 6

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. fib(4) returns 3 (the sequence is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3). Last question:

Which code correctly creates a class and instantiates an object?

A) class Dog
    name = 'Buddy'

dog = Dog()

B) class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

dog = Dog('Buddy')

C) Dog class:
    self.name = 'Buddy'

D) Dog = {'name': 'Buddy'}

### Human:
A
