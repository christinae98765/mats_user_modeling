Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What does the following function return?

def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

print(greet("Alice"))

A) Hello, Alice
B) name
C) "Hello, " + name
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function concatenates the strings and returns the result. Next question:

What is the output of this code?

x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 7
B) 13
C) 103
D) 30

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will this code output?

def mystery(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)

print(mystery(4))

A) 4
B) 10
C) 24
D) 1

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This is a recursive function that calculates factorials. Next question:

Consider this code:

data = {"name": "Bob", "age": 25, "age": 26}
print(data["age"])

What is the output?

A) 25
B) 26
C) Error
D) "age"

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. When duplicate keys exist in a dictionary, the last value overwrites previous ones. Next question:

What happens when you run this code?

try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero")

A) 10 / 0
B) Cannot divide by zero
C) Error
D) 0

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The try-except block catches the error and executes the except block. Next question:

What is the output of this code?

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2
C) 3
D) 0 1 2 3

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does the .split() method do?

text = "apple,banana,cherry"
result = text.split(",")
print(result)

A) ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
B) "apple,banana,cherry"
C) 3
D) ["a", "p", "p", "l", "e", ",", ...]

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The split method divides the string at the specified delimiter. Next question:

What is the value of z after this code runs?

z = 5
z = z + 2
print(z)

A) 5
B) 7
C) 52
D) 2

### Human:
B
