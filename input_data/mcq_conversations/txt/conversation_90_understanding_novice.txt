### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions to practice your Python skills.

What will this code print?
print("Hello" + " " + "World")

A) Hello World
B) HelloWorld
C) Hello + + World
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Now let's try something more challenging.

What does this code output?
my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
print(my_dict["b"] + my_dict.get("d", 5))

A) 5
B) 7
C) KeyError
D) None

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The .get() method returns a default value if the key doesn't exist.

What will this recursive function return when called as mystery(3)?
def mystery(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)

A) 3
B) 6
C) 9
D) 27

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function multiplies n by the result of the recursive call.

Consider this code with a custom class:
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def bark(self):
        return self.name + " says woof"

my_dog = Dog("Rex")
print(my_dog.bark())

What is printed?
A) Dog says woof
B) Rex says woof
C) None
D) Error

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The class is properly defined and instantiated.

What does this code output?
def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y

result = add_numbers(4, 5)
print(result * 2)

A) 9
B) 18
C) 45
D) 4 + 5 * 2

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function returns the sum, which is then multiplied by 2.

What will this code print?
x = 5
if x > 3:
    print("Greater")
else:
    print("Less or equal")

A) Greater
B) Less or equal
C) Both statements
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Finally, consider this list operation:
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_list.reverse()
print(my_list[0])

What is printed?
A) 1
B) 3
C) 5
D) None

### Human:
B
