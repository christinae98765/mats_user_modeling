### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What will this code output?
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Some sound"

dog = Animal("Rex")
print(dog.speak())
```
A) Rex
B) Some sound
C) Animal
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The method returns a string, not the name attribute.

Next question: What does the following code print?
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_list.pop()
print(my_list)
```
A) [1, 2, 3, 4]
B) [2, 3, 4, 5]
C) 5
D) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The pop() method removes and returns the last item, but we're printing the list itself.

Next question: What is the output of this code?
```python
text = "python"
print(text.upper())
```
A) python
B) PYTHON
C) Python
D) PYTHON()

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The upper() method converts all characters to uppercase.

Next question: What will this recursive function return when called with recursion(3)?
```python
def recursion(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * recursion(n - 1)
```
A) 3
B) 6
C) 9
D) 0

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This function calculates factorials.

Next question: What is the output of this code?
```python
x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)
```
A) 15
B) 510
C) 5 10
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct.

Next question: What will print("Hello " + "World") output?
A) Hello World
B) HelloWorld
C) Hello + World
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct.

Next question: What does this code output?
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(4))
```
A) 2
B) 3
C) 4
D) 5

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. You need to trace through the recursive calls carefully.

Last question: What will this code print?
```python
data = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print(data.get("city", "Unknown"))
```
A) Alice
B) 25
C) Unknown
D) Error

### Human:
B
