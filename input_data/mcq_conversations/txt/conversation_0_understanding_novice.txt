### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's get started.

What will this code output?

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def bark(self):
        return self.name + " says woof"

d = Dog("Rex")
print(d.bark())

A) Rex
B) Rex says woof
C) Dog says woof
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The method returns the concatenation of the instance's name with " says woof", so it would output "Rex says woof". Let's continue.

What does the following code return?

def greet(name):
    message = "Hello, " + name
    return message

result = greet("Alice")

A) "Hello, Alice"
B) Hello, Alice
C) "Alice"
D) None

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
Not quite. The function explicitly returns the concatenated message string. Next question.

Consider this recursive function:

def mystery(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)

What is mystery(5)?

A) 5
B) 120
C) 15
D) 25

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Let's move on.

What will print(5 * 3) output?

A) 15
B) 53
C) 8
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.

What is the value of x after this code runs?

x = 10
x = x + 5

A) 5
B) 10
C) 15
D) 105

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.

What does this code do?

text = "python"
result = text.upper()

A) result = "PYTHON" and text = "python"
B) result = "python" and text = "PYTHON"
C) Both text and result become "PYTHON"
D) Error because strings cannot be modified

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The upper() method returns a new string without changing the original, so result would be "PYTHON" but text would still be "python". Let's continue.

What will this code output?

data = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
for key in data:
    if data[key] > 1:
        print(key)

A) b c
B) 2 3
C) b
   c
D) a b c

### Human:
D
