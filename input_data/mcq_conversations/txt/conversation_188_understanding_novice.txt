### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! I'll help you practice Python. Let's start with our first question.

What does the following function return?

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)

A) Returns nothing
B) 8
C) Prints 5 and 3
D) Returns the function itself

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function does return a value. Next question:

Consider this recursive function:

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

What is factorial(4)?

A) 24
B) 10
C) 4
D) 16

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Let's try an easier one:

What is the output of the following code?

name = "Alice"
print(name)

A) Alice
B) "Alice"
C) name
D) undefined

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's the next question:

What does the following code output?

x = 10
y = 5
print(x - y)

A) 15
B) 5
C) xy
D) -5

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the result of calling the upper() method on a string?

text = "hello"
result = text.upper()
print(result)

A) hello
B) HELLO
C) Hello
D) hElLo

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Let's continue:

What is the output of this code?

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2
C) 3
D) 0 1 2 3

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will this code do?

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
my_list.append(5)
print(len(my_list))

A) 4
B) 5
C) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The code prints the length of the list, not the list itself. Here's our final question:

Which of these correctly defines a class and creates an instance?

A) class Dog: pass
   my_dog = Dog()
B) Dog = class: pass
   my_dog = Dog
C) def Dog(): pass
   my_dog = Dog
D) Dog class: pass
   my_dog = Dog()

### Human:
D
