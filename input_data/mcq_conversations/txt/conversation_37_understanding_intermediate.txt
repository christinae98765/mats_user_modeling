### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

What does the following function return?

def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

result = greet("Alice")

A) Hello, Alice
B) "Hello, Alice"
C) Hello Alice
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Now let's try another function question.

What is the output of this code?

def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

print(multiply(4, 3))

A) 7
B) 12
C) 43
D) 34

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Moving to a harder question now.

Consider this recursive function:

def count_down(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    return n + count_down(n - 1)

What does count_down(4) return?

A) 10
B) 4
C) 8
D) 6

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function sums all numbers from n down to 0, so count_down(4) returns 4+3+2+1+0 = 10.

Next question: What will this code output?

my_list = [10, 20, 30]
my_list.append(40)
print(len(my_list))

A) 3
B) 4
C) Error
D) 40

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's an easy one.

What is the value of x after this code runs?

x = 5
x = x + 3

A) 5
B) 8
C) 3
D) 53

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Now a more complex question.

Consider this code with nested dictionaries:

student = {
    "name": "Bob",
    "grades": {"math": 85, "science": 90}
}

What does student["grades"]["math"] return?

A) Bob
B) grades
C) 85
D) KeyError

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. You need to access the nested dictionary value, which is 85.

Last question: What is the output?

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0\n1\n2
D) 3

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's your final question.

Which of these correctly implements a class with a constructor?

A) class Dog {def __init__(self, name): self.name = name}
B) class Dog: def __init__(name): self.name = name
C) class Dog: def __init__(self, name): self.name = name
D) class Dog: init(self, name): self.name = name

### Human:
A
