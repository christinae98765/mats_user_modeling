### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a challenging question.

Consider a recursive function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number. Which implementation correctly returns the 5th Fibonacci number (which should be 5)?
A) def fib(n): return n if n <= 1 else fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
B) def fib(n): return n + fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
C) def fib(n): return fib(n-1) * fib(n-2)
D) def fib(n): return fib(n-2) - fib(n-1)
