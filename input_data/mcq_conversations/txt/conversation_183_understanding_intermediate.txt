### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

Consider this code:
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

d = Dog("Rex")
print(d.speak())
```
What is the output?
A) Some sound
B) Woof
C) Rex
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The Dog class overrides the speak method, so it returns "Woof".

Next question: What is the output of this code?
```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)
```
A) 13
B) 7
C) 30
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question: What does the following code output?
```python
word = "hello"
print(word.upper())
```
A) HELLO
B) hello
C) Hello
D) ERROR

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question: Which of the following prints the number 5?
A) print("5")
B) print(2 + 3)
C) Both A and B
D) Neither A nor B

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. While both output something with 5 in it, print("5") outputs a string and print(2 + 3) outputs an integer.

Next question: What is the output of this recursive function?
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(4))
```
A) 4
B) 10
C) 24
D) 16

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function calculates 4 × 3 × 2 × 1, which equals 24.

Next question: What does this code output?
```python
data = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print(data["name"])
```
A) Alice
B) age
C) 25
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question: What is the output?
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(my_list[2])
```
A) 1
B) 2
C) 3
D) 4

### Human:
C
