### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What will this code output?

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

my_pet = Dog("Rex")
print(my_pet.speak())
```
A) Some sound
B) Woof
C) Rex
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The Dog class overrides the speak method, so it returns "Woof".

Next question: What is the output of the following code?

```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)
```
A) 13
B) 7
C) 30
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct.

Next question: Consider this recursive function:

```python
def mystery(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)

print(mystery(4))
```
What is the output?
A) 4
B) 10
C) 24
D) 1

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This function calculates factorials. mystery(4) = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24. Actually, that is correct!

Next question: What does the following code print?

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[1].upper())
```
A) APPLE
B) BANANA
C) CHERRY
D) banana

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct.

Next question: What is the output of this code?

```python
my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
for key in my_dict:
    if my_dict[key] > 1:
        print(key, end=" ")
```
A) a b c
B) b c
C) 2 3
D) a

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The condition checks if the value is greater than 1. Only "b" (value 2) and "c" (value 3) meet this condition, so the output is "b c".

Next question: What will this print?

```python
text = "hello"
print(text[0])
```
A) h
B) e
C) 5
D) hello

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct.

Last question: What is the output of this code?

```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
```
A) 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2 3
C) 0 1 2
D) 3

### Human:
C
