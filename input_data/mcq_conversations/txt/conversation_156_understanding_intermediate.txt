### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What is the output of the following code?
```python
name = "Python"
print(name + " rocks")
```
A) Python rocks
B) name + " rocks"
C) Python
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Now let's try something more challenging.

Consider this recursive function. What does it return when called with mystery(5)?
```python
def mystery(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)
```
A) 5
B) 120
C) 15
D) 1

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function computes factorials, so mystery(5) = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.

Let's try another one. What is the output of this code?
```python
data = {'a': [1, 2, 3], 'b': {'x': 10}}
print(data['b']['x'])
```
A) [1, 2, 3]
B) {'x': 10}
C) 10
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. You need to access the nested dictionary with both keys: data['b']['x'] gives you 10.

Let's move to an easier question. What does this code print?
```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)
```
A) 13
B) 7
C) 3
D) 10

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the output of this code?
```python
words = "hello world"
print(words.split())
```
A) 'hello world'
B) ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
C) ['hello', 'world']
D) hello world

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Now for a harder one:

What does this code output?
```python
class Counter:
    def __init__(self, start):
        self.value = start
    def increment(self):
        self.value += 1
        return self.value

c = Counter(5)
print(c.increment())
print(c.increment())
```
A) 5, 6
B) 6, 7
C) 6\n7
D) 5, 5

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The increment method adds 1 to self.value each time, so it prints 6 then 7.

Here's the next question:

What is the output of this code?
```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
```
A) 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2
C) 3
D) 0 1 2 3

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Last question:

What does this function return when called with sumlist([2, 4, 6])?
```python
def sumlist(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total
```
A) 12
B) 6
C) [2, 4, 6]
D) 2

### Human:
A
