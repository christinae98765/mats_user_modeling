### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

Consider this code:
```
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

dog = Dog("Rex")
print(dog.speak())
```
What is the output?
A) Some sound
B) Woof
C) Rex
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The Dog class overrides the speak method, so it returns "Woof". Let's move on.

What does the following function return?
```
def greet(name):
    message = "Hello, " + name
    return message

result = greet("Alice")
```
A) Hello, Alice
B) Alice
C) "Hello, " + "Alice"
D) None

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function returns the concatenated string "Hello, Alice". Let's continue.

What will this code output?
```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(4))
```
A) 2
B) 3
C) 4
D) 5

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct answer is 3. Now for the next question.

What is the output of this code?
```
x = 10
y = 5
print(x - y)
```
A) 15
B) 5
C) -5
D) 50

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.

What will print("Python" + "Rules") output?
A) PythonRules
B) Python Rules
C) Python + Rules
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.

What is the output of the following?
```
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
```
A) 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2
C) 3
D) 1 2 3 (on separate lines)

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Last question.

What does the following code do?
```
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
result = names[1]
```
A) Returns "Alice"
B) Returns "Bob"
C) Returns "Charlie"
D) Returns the entire list

### Human:
C
