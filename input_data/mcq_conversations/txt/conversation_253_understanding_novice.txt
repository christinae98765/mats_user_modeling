### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions to practice your Python skills.

Question 1: What does the following function return?

def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)

A) 8
B) 53
C) None
D) "5 3"

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds the two numbers together. Let's move on.

Question 2: What will this code output?

name = "Python"
print(name)

A) name
B) Python
C) "Python"
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Question 3: What is the result of this arithmetic expression?

result = 10 - 4 + 2
print(result)

A) 4
B) 6
C) 8
D) 12

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's a more challenging question:

Question 4: What will this code output?

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def bark(self):
        return self.name + " says woof"

dog = Dog("Rex")
print(dog.bark())

A) Dog says woof
B) Rex says woof
C) self.name says woof
D) Error: bark() requires 2 arguments

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The method works correctly when called on the object. Let's continue.

Question 5: What does the upper() method do in Python?

text = "hello"
result = text.upper()

A) Removes all vowels from the string
B) Converts the string to uppercase letters
C) Counts the number of characters
D) Reverses the string

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The upper() method performs a different transformation on strings.

Question 6: What is the output of this code?

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers[2])

A) 1
B) 2
C) 3
D) 4

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Remember that list indexing starts at 0. Let's try another challenging question.

Question 7: What will this recursive function output when called with n=3?

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(3))

A) 3
B) 6
C) 9
D) Infinite recursion error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Let's finish with one more question.

Question 8: What is the output of this code?

x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)

A) "5 10"
B) 15
C) 510
D) Error

### Human:
B
