### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

What does the following function return?

def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y

result = add_numbers(5, 3)

What is the value of result?
A) 8
B) 53
C) 35
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds the two parameters together, so 5 + 3 equals 8.

Next question: What does the .upper() method do to a string?

word = "hello"
word.upper()

A) Removes all vowels
B) Converts the string to all uppercase letters
C) Reverses the string
D) Counts the number of letters

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The .upper() method converts the string to all uppercase letters.

Next question: What is the output of this code?

my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print(my_dict["name"])

A) {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
B) name
C) Alice
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. When you access a dictionary key with ["name"], you get the value "Alice", not the entire dictionary.

Next question: What will this recursive function return when called with n=3?

def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

A) 3
B) 6
C) 9
D) 1

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The factorial of 3 is 3 × 2 × 1, which equals 6.

Next question: What is the output of this code?

x = 10
y = 5
print(x - y)

A) 5
B) 15
C) 105
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question: What will this print?

name = "Python"
print("I love " + name)

A) name
B) Python
C) I love Python
D) I love name

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question: What is the output of this code?

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers[1:3])

A) [1, 2, 3]
B) [2, 3]
C) [3, 4]
D) [2, 3, 4]

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. List slicing with [1:3] gets elements at indices 1 and 2, which are [2, 3].

Last question: What is the output of this code?

if 7 > 5:
    print("Seven is greater")
else:
    print("Five is greater")

A) Five is greater
B) Seven is greater
C) 7 > 5
D) Error

### Human:
B
