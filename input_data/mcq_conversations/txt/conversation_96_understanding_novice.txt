### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What will this code print?
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Sound"

dog = Animal("Rex")
print(dog.speak())
```
A) Rex
B) Sound
C) Animal
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The speak() method returns the string "Sound", not the name.

Next question: What does this code output?
```python
x = 5
y = 3
print(x + y)
```
A) 8
B) 53
C) xy
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Moving on.

What will print("Hello" + " World") output?
A) Hello World
B) HelloWorld
C) Hello + World
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.

What is the output of this code?
```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
```
A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0\n1\n2
D) 3

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Let's continue.

What does this function return when called as mystery(5)?
```python
def mystery(x):
    return x * 2 + 1
```
A) 10
B) 11
C) 6
D) 5

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function multiplies x by 2, then adds 1.

Which method removes and returns the last item from a list?
A) pop()
B) remove()
C) delete()
D) shift()

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. remove() takes a value as an argument, while pop() removes the last item.

What will this code output?
```python
while True:
    break
print("Done")
```
A) Done
B) Infinite loop
C) Error
D) Nothing

### Human:
D
