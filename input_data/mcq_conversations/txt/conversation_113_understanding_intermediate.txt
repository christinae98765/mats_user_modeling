### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Absolutely! Let's begin.

Consider this code:
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

dog = Dog("Rex")
print(dog.speak())
```
What will be printed?
A) Some sound
B) Woof
C) Rex
D) Error: Dog has no speak method

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The Dog class overrides the speak method, so it returns "Woof".

Next question: What is the output of this code?
```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x % y)
```
A) 3.33
B) 0
C) 1
D) 3

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. The modulo operator returns the remainder.

Next question: What will this print?
```python
name = "Python"
print(name[0] + name[1])
```
A) Py
B) Python
C) P
D) ot

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. String indexing and concatenation work as expected.

Next question: What does this function return?
```python
def process(items):
    result = []
    for item in items:
        result.append(item * 2)
    return result

print(process([1, 2, 3]))
```
A) [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
B) [2, 4, 6]
C) 1, 2, 3
D) [2, 2, 2]

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Now consider this recursive function:
```python
def mystery(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)

print(mystery(5))
```
What will be printed?
A) 5
B) 15
C) 120
D) 25

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This calculates the factorial: 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

Next question: What is the output of this code?
```python
text = "hello"
print(text.upper())
```
A) HELLO
B) hello
C) Hello
D) hELLO

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. The upper() method converts the string to uppercase.

Next question: What will this print?
```python
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print(count)
    count = count + 1
```
A) 0 1 2 3
B) 1 2 3
C) 0
D) 0 1 2

### Human:
D
