### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

What does the following function return?
```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
```
What is the value of result?
A) "5 3"
B) 8
C) 53
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function returns the sum of the two numbers. Let's move on.

What is the output of this code?
```python
x = 10
print(x)
```
A) 10.0
B) "10"
C) 10
D) x

### Human:

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does the upper() method do to a string?
```python

That's not quite right. The upper() method converts all characters to uppercase. Next question:

Consider this recursive function:
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
```
What does factorial(4) return?
A) 24
B) 4
C) 16
D) 10

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The factorial function multiplies all positive integers up to n. Next question:

What is the output of this code involving a dictionary?
```python
student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 20}
print(student["age"])
```
A) "age"
B) 20
C) "20"
D) KeyError

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The code accesses the value associated with the key. Next question:

What is the output of this code?
```python
name = "Python"
print(name[0])
```
A) Python
B) 1
C) P
D) Error

### Human:
