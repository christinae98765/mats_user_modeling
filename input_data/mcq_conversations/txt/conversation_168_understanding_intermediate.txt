### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions to practice your Python skills.

What will this function return?

def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

print(greet("Alice"))

A) Hello, Alice
B) Hello, name
C) Alice
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Now for a harder one:

What is the output of this code?

def mystery(lst):
    if len(lst) == 0:
        return 0
    return lst[0] + mystery(lst[1:])

print(mystery([1, 2, 3, 4]))

A) [1, 2, 3, 4]
B) 10
C) 4
D) 1

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This uses recursion to sum all elements. Let's move on.

What does the following code output?

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit.upper())

A) apple banana cherry
B) APPLE\nBANANA\nCHERRY (on separate lines)
C) [APPLE, BANANA, CHERRY]
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Consider this code with a class:

class Counter:
    count = 0
    def __init__(self):
        Counter.count += 1

c1 = Counter()
c2 = Counter()
print(Counter.count)

A) 0
B) 1
C) 2
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The class variable increments with each instance. Let's continue.

What is the output of this code?

x = 5
y = 3
print(x * y + 2)

A) 17
B) 25
C) 10
D) 8

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's the next one:

What will this code print?

data = {"a": [1, 2, 3], "b": {"x": 10, "y": 20}}
print(data["b"]["x"] + data["a"][1])

A) 12
B) 13
C) Error
D) [1, 2, 3]

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Let me explain: data["b"]["x"] is 10 and data["a"][1] is 2, so the sum is 12.

What will print("Python".lower()) output?

A) PYTHON
B) Python
C) python
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Final question:

What does this code output?

def calculate(x, y=5):
    return x * y

print(calculate(3) + calculate(2, 4))

A) 23
B) 30
C) 8
D) Error

### Human:
A
