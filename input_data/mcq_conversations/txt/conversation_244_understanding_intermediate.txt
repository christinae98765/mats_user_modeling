### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What is the output of the following code?
name = "Alice"
print(name)

A) Alice
B) "Alice"
C) name
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Let's continue.

What is the result of this calculation?
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 13
B) 7
C) 30
D) 3.33

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does the following code output?
text = "python"
print(text.upper())

A) python
B) PYTHON
C) Python
D) PYTHON()

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Now a harder one:

Consider this recursive function:
def countdown(n):
    if n == 0:
        return
    print(n)
    countdown(n - 1)

countdown(3)

What is the output?
A) 3 2 1
B) 3 2 1 0
C) 1 2 3
D) 0

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function stops when n equals 0, so it doesn't print 0. Let's move on.

What does this code output?
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(my_list[2])

A) 1
B) 2
C) 3
D) 4

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the output?
for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2
C) 0 1 2 3
D) 3

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's the next one:

What will this function return?
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 7)
print(result)

A) "5 7"
B) 12
C) 57
D) add_numbers

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Final question:

Consider this class:
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def greet(self):
        return "Hello, " + self.name

p = Person("Bob")
print(p.greet())

What is the output?
A) Hello, Person
B) Hello, Bob
C) Person Bob
D) Error: name not defined

### Human:
A
