### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions.

Consider this code:
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

d = Dog("Rex")
print(d.speak())
```
What is the output?
A) Some sound
B) Woof
C) Rex
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The Dog class overrides the speak method, so it returns "Woof" instead.

Next question: What will this code output?
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(4))
```
A) 4
B) 10
C) 24
D) 16

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The recursion calculates 4 × 3 × 2 × 1, which equals 24.

Next question: What does the following code output?
```python
words = ["hello", "world", "python"]
result = [w.upper() for w in words]
print(result)
```
A) ['HELLO', 'WORLD', 'PYTHON']
B) ['hello', 'world', 'python']
C) 'HELLOWORLDPYTHON'
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct! The list comprehension applies the upper() method to each string.

Next question: What is the output of this code?
```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)
```
A) 7
B) 13
C) 103
D) 30

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct! 10 minus 3 equals 7.

Next question: What does this function return?
```python
def greet(name):
    message = "Hello, " + name + "!"
    return message

result = greet("Alice")
print(result)
```
A) Hello, Alice
B) Hello, Alice!
C) name
D) None

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct! The function concatenates the strings and returns "Hello, Alice!".

Next question: What is the output of this code?
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(my_list[2])
```
A) 1
B) 2
C) 3
D) 4

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct! List indexing starts at 0, so index 2 refers to the third element, which is 3.

Next question: What is the output of this code?
```python
if 5 > 3:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```
A) No
B) Yes
C) 5 > 3
D) Error

### Human:
B
