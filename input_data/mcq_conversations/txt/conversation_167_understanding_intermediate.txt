### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's begin with some practice questions.

What does the following function return?

def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)

A) 8
B) 53
C) Error
D) None

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Which string method removes leading and trailing whitespace?

A) strip()
B) trim()
C) remove()
D) clean()

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's a more challenging one:

What is the output of the following code?

my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
for key in my_dict:
    if my_dict[key] > 1:
        print(key)

A) a
B) b c
C) 1 2 3
D) a b c

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B—it prints the keys where the value is greater than 1.

Next question:

What is the output of this code?

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_list.append(6)
print(len(my_list))

A) 5
B) 6
C) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next:

What does this code output?

x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 7
B) 13
C) 103
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's the next one:

What is the result of this code?

name = "Python"
print(name + " is great")

A) Python is great
B) name is great
C) Pythonandisgreatn
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Now for a difficult one:

What does this recursive function return when called with factorial(4)?

def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

A) 4
B) 10
C) 24
D) 120

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is C—factorial(4) equals 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24.

Final question:

Which of these correctly defines a class in Python?

A) class MyClass
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 0
B) class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 0
C) def MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 0
D) class MyClass():
    def init(self):
        self.value = 0

### Human:
C
