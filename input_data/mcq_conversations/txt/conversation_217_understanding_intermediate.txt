### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions to practice your Python skills.

Question 1: What will this function return?

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)

A) 8
B) 53
C) Error
D) None

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Moving on.

Question 2: What is the output of the following code?

x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 13
B) 7
C) 103
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.

Question 3: What will be printed by this code?

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def speak(self):
        return self.name + " makes a sound"

dog = Animal("Rex")
print(dog.speak())

A) Animal makes a sound
B) Rex makes a sound
C) name makes a sound
D) Error: speak() is not defined

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B - the instance name "Rex" is used in the method.

Question 4: What is the output of this recursive function?

def countdown(n):
    if n == 0:
        return "Done"
    else:
        return str(n) + " " + countdown(n - 1)

print(countdown(3))

A) 3 2 1 Done
B) 0 1 2 3
C) 3 2 1 0 Done
D) Error: maximum recursion depth exceeded

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is A - the recursion stops at 0 and returns "Done", then concatenates backwards as the call stack unwinds.

Question 5: Consider this code with a nested dictionary. What is the output?

student = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "grades": {
        "math": 95,
        "science": 87
    }
}

print(student["grades"]["math"])

A) {'math': 95, 'science': 87}
B) Alice
C) 95
D) math

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is C - you need to access the nested key "math" to get the value 95.

Question 6: What does this code print?

word = "python"
print(word.upper())

A) python
B) PYTHON
C) Python
D) pYTHON

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.

Question 7: What is the output of this loop?

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0\n1\n2
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. The newlines are implicit in the print function. Final question.

Question 8: What will this function return?

def multiply_list(numbers):
    result = 1
    for num in numbers:
        result *= num
    return result

print(multiply_list([2, 3, 4]))

A) 24
B) 234
C) 9
D) [2, 3, 4]

### Human:
A
