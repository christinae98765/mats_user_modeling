### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What is the output of print(5 * 2)?
A) 10
B) 52
C) 7
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will this code print?
x = 'Hello'
print(x + ' World')
A) Hello World
B) x + ' World'
C) HelloWorld
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the output of the following?
if 10 > 5:
    print('yes')
else:
    print('no')
A) no
B) yes
C) 10 > 5
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does the following function return?
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
print(add(3, 4))
A) 34
B) ab
C) 7
D) None

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds the two numbers together. Next question:

What is the output of this code?
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(my_list[2])
A) 1
B) 2
C) 3
D) 4

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. List indexing starts at 0, so index 2 refers to the third element. Next question:

What does this code do?
my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}
my_dict['age'] = 26
print(my_dict['age'])
A) KeyError
B) 25
C) 26
D) None

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The code changes the age to 26, then prints it. Next question:

Consider this recursive function. What does it return?
def count_down(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    return n + count_down(n - 1)
print(count_down(3))
A) 3
B) 6
C) 0
D) 1

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds each number as it recurses, so it sums 3 + 2 + 1 + 0. Next question:

What is the output of this code?
text = 'python'
print(text.upper())
A) python
B) PYTHON
C) Python
D) pYTHON

### Human:
A
