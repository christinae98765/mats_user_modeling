### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

Consider this code:
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

d = Dog("Rex")
print(d.speak())
```
What is the output?
A) Some sound
B) Woof
C) Rex
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The Dog class overrides the speak method, so it returns "Woof".

Next question: What does the following code output?
```python
def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):
    return greeting + " " + name

print(greet("Alice", "Hi"))
```
A) Hello Alice
B) Hi Alice
C) Alice Hi
D) greet Alice

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question: What will this recursive function return when called with mystery(5)?
```python
def mystery(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)
```
A) 5
B) 15
C) 120
D) 25

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This function calculates factorial, so mystery(5) = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.

Next question: What is the output of this code?
```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x % y)
```
A) 3
B) 1
C) 10
D) 13

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question: What does the following code output?
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[1].upper())
```
A) APPLE
B) BANANA
C) CHERRY
D) apple

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question: What is the output of this code?
```python
name = "Python"
print(len(name))
```
A) 5
B) 7
C) 6
D) 8

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question: What will this code print?
```python
mydict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
for key in mydict:
    if mydict[key] > 1:
        print(key)
```
A) a
B) b c
C) b
D) 1 2 3

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The loop prints each key on a separate line where the value is greater than 1, so it prints "b" and then "c".

Last question: What does this code output?
```python
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```
A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0 1 2 3
D) 0
1
2

### Human:
D
