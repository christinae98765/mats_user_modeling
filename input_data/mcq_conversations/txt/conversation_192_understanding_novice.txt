### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions to practice your Python skills.

What will this code print?
print("Hello" + " World")
A) Hello World
B) Hello + World
C) HelloWorld
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's the next question:

What does the following function return?
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
result = add(3, 5)
A) 8
B) Nothing, functions don't return values
C) "3, 5"
D) 35

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds the two numbers together, not concatenates them. Next question:

Which string method converts text to uppercase?
A) upper_case()
B) uppercase()
C) upper()
D) to_upper()

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct method is upper(). Moving on:

What will this code output?
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print(my_dict["name"])
A) {"name": "Alice"}
B) Alice
C) name
D) KeyError

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Dictionary access with a key returns the value, not the key-value pair. Next question:

What is the output of this code?
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)
A) 13
B) 7
C) 103
D) -7

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's the next question:

What does this recursive function return when called with factorial(4)?
def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
A) 4
B) 10
C) 24
D) 1

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Factorial multiplies the number by all positive integers below it, so 4! equals 24. Next question:

What will this code do?
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_list.append(6)
print(len(my_list))
A) 5
B) 6
C) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
D) 7

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The append() method adds an element to the list, so the length becomes 6. Final question:

Which code correctly defines a class and creates an instance?
A) class Dog
   my_dog = Dog()
B) class Dog:
   my_dog = Dog()
C) Dog = class:
   my_dog = Dog()
D) def Dog:
   my_dog = Dog()

### Human:
C
