### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What does the following function return?

def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y

result = add_numbers(5, 3)

What is the value of result?
A) 8
B) 53
C) "5" + "3"
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds the two numbers together, so 5 + 3 equals 8.

Next question: What does the upper() method do to a string?

text = "hello"
text.upper()

A) Removes the text
B) Converts all letters to uppercase
C) Adds numbers to the string
D) Reverses the string

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The upper() method converts all letters to uppercase, so "hello" becomes "HELLO".

Next question: What will this code output?

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(4))

A) 4
B) 10
C) 24
D) 16

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This is a recursive function that multiplies 4 × 3 × 2 × 1, which equals 24.

Next question: Which of the following correctly creates a list in Python?

A) list = (1, 2, 3)
B) list = [1, 2, 3]
C) list = {1, 2, 3}
D) list = 1, 2, 3 []

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Option B uses square brackets, which creates a list. Option C uses curly braces, which creates a set.

Next question: What will this code output?

my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print(my_dict["name"])

A) {"name": "Alice"}
B) Alice
C) "Alice"
D) KeyError

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. When you access a dictionary value with a key, it returns the value itself without quotes, so the output is Alice (not as a quoted string).

Next question: What is the output of this code?

print("Hello" + " " + "World")

A) Hello World
B) HelloWorld
C) "Hello World"
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. String concatenation combines the strings together.

Next question: What does this code do?

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def bark(self):
        return self.name + " says woof!"

dog = Dog("Buddy")
print(dog.bark())

A) Prints "Buddy says woof!"
B) Prints "Dog says woof!"
C) Creates a string called bark
D) Error - classes require more setup

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The Dog class stores "Buddy" in the name attribute, so dog.bark() returns "Buddy says woof!".

Next question: What is the output of this code?

x = 10
y = 20
print(x + y)

A) 1020
B) 30
C) xy
D) Error

### Human:
B
