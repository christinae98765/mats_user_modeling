### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What is the output of this code?
name = "Alice"
print(name)

A) Alice
B) "Alice"
C) name
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does the following function return?
def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y
result = add_numbers(3, 5)

A) 8
B) "35"
C) x + y
D) None

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function returns the sum as a number. Next question:

What is the output of this code?
my_dict = {"name": "Bob", "age": 25}
print(my_dict["name"])

A) {"name": "Bob"}
B) age
C) Bob
D) KeyError

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The key exists in the dictionary. Next question:

What is the value of x after this code runs?
x = 10
x = x + 5

A) 10
B) 15
C) 105
D) 5

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Consider this recursive function:
def countdown(n):
    if n == 0:
        return
    print(n)
    countdown(n - 1)

What gets printed when you call countdown(3)?

A) 3 2 1 0
B) 3 2 1
C) 1 2 3
D) 0

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The base case is when n equals 0, so it stops before printing 0. Next question:

What is the output of this code?
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(my_list[2])

A) 1
B) 2
C) 3
D) 5

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will this code output?
for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 0 1 2 3
B) 1 2 3
C) 0 1 2
D) 3

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Last question:
