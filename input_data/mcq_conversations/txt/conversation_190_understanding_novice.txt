### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What will this code print?

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Sound"

dog = Animal("Rex")
print(dog.speak())

A) Rex
B) Sound
C) Animal
D) None

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The speak() method returns "Sound", not the name. Let's move on to the next question.

What does the upper() string method do?
A) Removes spaces from a string
B) Converts all characters to uppercase
C) Reverses the string
D) Counts the number of characters

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The upper() method converts characters to uppercase, not removes spaces. Here's the next question.

Consider this recursive function:

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

What is factorial(4)?
A) 16
B) 24
C) 10
D) 4

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This calculates 4 × 3 × 2 × 1, which is 24. Let's continue.

What will this code output?

my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
my_dict["d"] = 4
print(my_dict.get("e", "Not found"))

A) KeyError
B) None
C) Not found
D) 4

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The get() method returns the default value "Not found" when a key doesn't exist.

What is the output of this code?

x = 5
y = 3
print(x + y)

A) 53
B) 8
C) 2
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.

What will this print?

name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(name + " is " + str(age))

A) Alice is 25
B) Alice is age
C) name is 25
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Moving on.

What does this code do?

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(10, 5)

A) Prints 15 to the screen
B) Stores 15 in the result variable
C) Creates a list with 10 and 5
D) Defines a variable called result

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function returns the sum and stores it in the result variable.

What is the output?

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2 on separate lines
C) 3
D) 0 3

### Human:
B
