### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

What will this code print?
name = "Alice"
print(name + " loves Python")
A) Alice loves Python
B) name loves Python
C) Alice + loves Python
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does the following function return?
def double(x):
    return x * 2
result = double(5)
A) 10
B) 5
C) 25
D) 52

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's a harder one:

What is the output of this code?
my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
my_dict["c"] = my_dict.get("a") + my_dict.get("b")
print(my_dict["c"])
A) 3
B) None
C) KeyError
D) 12

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is A—get() returns the values, so 1 + 2 = 3.

Next question:

What does this code output?
for i in range(3):
    if i == 1:
        continue
    print(i)
A) 0 1 2
B) 0 2
C) 1
D) 0 1

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the value of x after this code runs?
x = 10
x = x - 3
x = x * 2
A) 14
B) 17
C) 4
D) 20

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's a challenging one:

What will this recursive function return when called as mystery(4)?
def mystery(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)
A) 4
B) 10
C) 24
D) 16

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This calculates factorial, so mystery(4) = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24.

Next question:

What does this code do?
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} makes a sound"
dog = Animal("Rex")
print(dog.speak())
A) Error - can't create class instance
B) Rex makes a sound
C) Animal makes a sound
D) None

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B—the instance variable self.name is set to "Rex", so it prints "Rex makes a sound".

Last question:

What is the output?
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_list = [x * 2 for x in my_list if x > 2]
print(my_list)
A) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
B) [6, 8, 10]
C) [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
D) [3, 4, 5]

### Human:
B
