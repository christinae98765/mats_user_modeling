### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

What will this function return?

```python
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

result = greet("Alice")
```

What is the value of `result`?
A) "Hello,"
B) "Hello, Alice"
C) "Alice"
D) None

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the output of the following code?

```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)
```

A) 13
B) 7
C) 10
D) 3

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Consider this code:

```python
def count_occurrences(lst, target):
    if not lst:
        return 0
    if lst[0] == target:
        return 1 + count_occurrences(lst[1:], target)
    else:
        return count_occurrences(lst[1:], target)

result = count_occurrences([1, 2, 2, 3, 2], 2)
```

What is the value of `result`?
A) 1
B) 2
C) 3
D) 5

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function recursively counts how many times the target appears in the list, so the answer is 3.

Let's move on:

What does this code output?

```python
word = "python"
print(word.upper())
```

A) python
B) PYTHON
C) Python
D) pYTHON

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Consider this class definition:

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.tricks = []
    
    def add_trick(self, trick):
        self.tricks.append(trick)

my_dog = Dog("Buddy")
my_dog.add_trick("sit")
my_dog.add_trick("fetch")
```

What is the value of `my_dog.tricks`?
A) ["Buddy"]
B) "sit" and "fetch"
C) ["sit", "fetch"]
D) []

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is C - `my_dog.tricks` is a list containing both trick strings.

Next question:

What will this loop print?

```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
```

A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0\n1\n2 (each on a new line)
D) range(3)

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the output of this code?

```python
name = "Python"
print(len(name))
```

A) "Python"
B) 6
C) 7
D) 0

### Human:
B
