### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some Python questions.

What will this code output?
print(10 - 3)
A) 7
B) 13
C) 103
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does the len() function return for the string "hello"?
A) The first character
B) 5
C) The last character
D) Returns nothing

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. len() returns the number of characters in a string.

What will this code print?
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(my_list[1])
A) 1
B) 2
C) 4
D) Error: index out of range

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. List indexing starts at 0, so index 1 refers to the second element.

What is the output of this code?
x = 5
y = 3
print(x * y)
A) 8
B) 15
C) 53
D) 35

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does the upper() method do?
A) Opens a file
B) Converts a string to uppercase
C) Removes spaces from a string
D) Reverses the string

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. upper() converts all characters to uppercase letters.

What will this print?
name = "Alice"
print(name)
A) name
B) Alice
C) "Alice"
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the output of this recursive function?
def count_down(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    return n + count_down(n - 1)
print(count_down(3))
A) 3
B) 6
C) 0
D) Infinite loop

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This function adds each number from 3 down to 1, which equals 6.

What will this code output?
data = {"name": "Bob", "age": 25}
print(data.get("city", "Unknown"))
A) KeyError
B) None
C) Unknown
D) Bob

### Human:
