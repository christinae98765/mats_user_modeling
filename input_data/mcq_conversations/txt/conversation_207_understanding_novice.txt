### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

What will this function return?

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)

A) 8
B) 53
C) None
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function returns the sum of the parameters. Let's move on.

Consider this recursive function. What does it return when called with mystery(4)?

def mystery(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)

A) 4
B) 24
C) 10
D) infinite recursion

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This is a factorial function. Next question:

Which of these correctly creates a class and instantiates an object?

A) class Dog
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    my_dog = Dog('Buddy')

B) class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    my_dog = Dog('Buddy')

C) class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
my_dog = Dog('Buddy')

D) class Dog():
    __init__(name):
        self.name = name
my_dog = Dog('Buddy')

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Let's continue.

What does this code snippet output?

my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
for key in my_dict:
    if my_dict[key] > 1:
        print(key)

A) a
B) b c
C) b
   c
D) 2 3

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The loop prints keys, not values. Next question:

Which of these correctly opens a file and reads its contents?

A) file = open('data.txt')
    content = file.read()
    file.close()

B) content = open('data.txt').read()

C) with open('data.txt') as file:
    content = file.read()

D) file.open('data.txt')
    content = file.read()

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. While A works, there's a safer approach. Let's continue.

What is the output of this code?

text = 'hello'
print(text.upper())

A) hello
B) HELLO
C) Hello
D) hELLO

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will this print?

x = 10
y = 5
print(x - y)

A) 15
B) 5
C) 105
D) Error

### Human:
B
