### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What is the output of this code?
print(10 - 3)

A) 7
B) 13
C) 103
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Consider this code:
def mystery(x):
    if x > 5:
        return x * 2
    else:
        return x + 10
    return x

What does mystery(3) return?

A) 6
B) 13
C) 3
D) 16

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B) 13, since 3 is not greater than 5, so it goes to the else branch and returns 3 + 10.

Next question:

What is the output of print('Hello' + ' ' + 'World')?

A) Hello World
B) HelloWorld
C) Hello + World
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Which string method removes whitespace from both ends of a string?

A) remove()
B) strip()
C) clean()
D) trim()

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B) strip().

Next question:

What will this code output?
my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}
for key in my_dict:
    if key == 'age':
        del my_dict[key]
print(len(my_dict))

A) 0
B) 1
C) 2
D) KeyError

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B) 1. After deleting the 'age' key, only 'name' remains in the dictionary, so the length is 1.

Next question:

What will print(5 * 2) output?

A) 10
B) 52
C) 7
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Which of the following correctly creates a list of numbers from 0 to 4?

A) list = [0:4]
B) list = range(0, 5)
C) list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
D) Both B and C

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is D) Both B and C. Both range(0, 5) and [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] create lists with those values.

Next question:

What does this code do?
text = 'python'
result = ''.join([char.upper() for char in text if char != 'o'])
print(result)

A) PYTHON
B) PYTN
C) python
D) PYTHN

### Human:
