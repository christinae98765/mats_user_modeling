### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's get started with some questions.

Consider this code:
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Generic sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

d = Dog("Rex")
print(d.speak())
```
What is the output?
A) Generic sound
B) Woof
C) Rex
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The Dog class overrides the speak method, so it returns "Woof" instead.

Let's move on. What does this code output?
```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)
```
A) 13
B) 7
C) 30
D) 103

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the output of this code?
```python
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

result = greet("Alice")
print(result)
```
A) Hello, Alice
B) Alice
C) greet
D) None

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Moving on:

What is the output of this code?
```python
word = "Python"
print(len(word))
```
A) 7
B) 5
C) 6
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will be printed by this code?
```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
```
A) 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2
C) 3
D) 1 2 3 on separate lines

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The range(3) produces 0, 1, 2, and each prints on a separate line.

Let's continue. Consider this code:
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(4))
```
What is the output?
A) 24
B) 4
C) 16
D) 10

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The factorial of 4 is 4 × 3 × 2 × 1, which equals 24.

Next question:

What does this code do?
```python
d = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
print(d.get("c", "Not found"))
```
A) KeyError
B) None
C) "Not found"
D) "c"

### Human:
C
