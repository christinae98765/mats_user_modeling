### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Absolutely! Let's begin with a challenging question.

Consider this code:
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

d = Dog("Rex")
print(d.speak())
```
What is the output?
A) Some sound
B) Woof
C) Rex
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The Dog class overrides the speak method. Let's move on.

What will this print?
```python
x = 5
y = 3
print(x * y + 2)
```
A) 17
B) 19
C) 30
D) 25

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Which of the following correctly implements a recursive function to calculate factorial?
A) def factorial(n): return n * factorial(n-1)
B) def factorial(n): return n if n == 1 else n * factorial(n-1)
C) def factorial(n): return factorial(n-1) * n if n > 0
D) def factorial(n): if n > 1: return factorial(n-1) * n else return 1

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Option B properly handles the base case. Next question:

What does this function return when called with my_func([1, 2, 3, 4])?
```python
def my_func(lst):
    total = 0
    for num in lst:
        total += num
    return total
```
A) [1, 2, 3, 4]
B) 10
C) 4
D) None

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's the next one:

What is the output of:
```python
text = "hello"
print(text[1:4])
```
A) hell
B) ell
C) llo
D) elh

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will this code print?
```python
def modify_dict(d):
    d['new_key'] = 'new_value'
    return d

original = {'a': 1}
result = modify_dict(original)
print(original == result)
```
A) False
B) True
C) KeyError
D) None

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Dictionaries are mutable, so modifying the parameter also modifies the original. Let's continue:

Which code will raise an error?
A) x = [1, 2, 3]; print(x[3])
B) x = [1, 2, 3]; print(x[2])
C) x = [1, 2, 3]; print(x[-1])
D) x = [1, 2, 3]; print(x[0])

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Option A will raise an IndexError. Let me ask another:

What is the output of this code?
```python
def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):
    return greeting + " " + name

print(greet("Alice", "Hi"))
```
A) Hello Alice
B) Hi Alice
C) Hello Hi Alice
D) Error

### Human:
B
