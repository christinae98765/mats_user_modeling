### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What is the output of this code?
name = "Alice"
print(name + " is here")

A) Alice is here
B) name is here
C) Alice + is here
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Moving on.

What does this function return when called with my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]?
def get_last(items):
    return items[-1]

A) 1
B) 5
C) [5]
D) None

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Consider this code:
data = {"name": "Bob", "age": 25}
data["city"] = "NYC"
print(data.get("country", "Unknown"))

What is printed?

A) None
B) KeyError
C) Unknown
D) country

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is C - the get() method with a default value returns "Unknown" when the key doesn't exist.

Let's try another:

def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(4))

A) 4
B) 10
C) 24
D) 16

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is C - factorial(4) = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24.

Let's move on:

What is the output?
x = 10
y = 3
print(x // y)

A) 3.33
B) 3
C) 4
D) 10

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does this code output?
text = "python"
print(text.upper())

A) python
B) PYTHON
C) Python
D) pYTHON

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the value of result?
for i in range(3):
    result = i

A) 0
B) 1
C) 2
D) 3

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Final question:

What does this code output?
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return self.name + " makes a sound"

dog = Animal("Rex")
print(dog.speak())

A) Rex makes a sound
B) Animal makes a sound
C) dog makes a sound
D) speak()

### Human:
D
