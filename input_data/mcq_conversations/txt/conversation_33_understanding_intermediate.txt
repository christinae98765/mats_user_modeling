### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What is the output of this code?
x = 10
y = 3
print(x + y)

A) 13
B) 103
C) 30
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will this code print?
name = "Python"
print("Hello " + name)

A) Hello name
B) Hello Python
C) Error
D) name

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Now let's try something harder:

What does this code output?
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def bark(self):
        return self.name + " barks"

d = Dog("Rex")
print(d.bark())

A) Dog barks
B) Rex barks
C) name barks
D) Error: bark is not defined

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B - the object's name attribute is "Rex", so it returns "Rex barks". Next question:

What is the output of this code?
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(5, 7)
print(result)

A) 57
B) 12
C) add
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will this print?
for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2
C) 3
D) 0 1 2 3

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Let's try a harder one:

What is the output of this recursive function?
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(3))

A) 3
B) 6
C) 9
D) 27

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B - factorial(3) = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6. Next question:

What does this code output?
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(my_list[2])

A) 1
B) 2
C) 3
D) 5

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Last question:

What will this code print?
text = "hello"
print(text.upper())

A) hello
B) HELLO
C) Hello
D) Error

### Human:
B
