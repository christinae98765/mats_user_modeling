### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions to practice your Python skills.

What will this code output?
print("Hello" + " " + "World")

A) Hello World
B) Hello World (with extra space)
C) HelloWorld
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the value of x after this code runs?
x = 10
x = x * 2 + 5

A) 20
B) 25
C) 15
D) 30

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B) 25 is incorrect; x * 2 equals 20, then adding 5 gives 25. Actually, that is correct. Let me move on.

Consider this recursive function. What does it return when called with mystery(4)?

def mystery(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)

A) 4
B) 10
C) 24
D) 16

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function calculates factorial, so mystery(4) = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.

What does this function return when called with get_length("Python")?

def get_length(text):
    return len(text)

A) 5
B) 6
C) Python
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will this code print?
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in my_list:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(num)

A) 1 3 5
B) 2 4
C) 2\n4
D) 1 2 3 4 5

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the output of this code?
text = "Python"
print(text.lower().replace("p", "P"))

A) python
B) Python
C) PYTHON
D) Python

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The code converts to lowercase first ("python"), then replaces "p" with "P", resulting in "Python"—but actually, that matches option B. Let me clarify: the replace only affects the first "p", so the answer is "Python".

Consider this class definition. What will obj.value be after instantiation?

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.value = x * 2

obj = MyClass(5)

A) 5
B) 10
C) 25
D) None

### Human:
C
