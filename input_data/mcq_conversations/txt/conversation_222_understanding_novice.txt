### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What does the following function return?

def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y

result = add_numbers(5, 3)

What is the value of result?
A) 8
B) 53
C) 3
D) The function has an error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds the two parameters together.

What is the output of this code?

name = "Python"
print(name)

A) name
B) "Python"
C) Python
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Which string method converts a string to uppercase?

word = "hello"

A) word.upper_case()
B) word.uppercase()
C) word.upper()
D) word.UPPER()

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct method is upper() with parentheses.

What does this code do?

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    print(num)

A) Prints the list as a single item
B) Prints each number on a separate line
C) Prints "num" five times
D) Prints the length of the list

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The for loop iterates through each element.

What will this code output?

count = 0
while count < 3:
    print(count)
    count = count + 1

A) 0 1 2 3
B) 0
1
2
C) 3
D) Infinite loop

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The while loop will terminate when count reaches 3.

What is the output of this code?

x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 13
B) 7
C) -7
D) 103
