### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What is the output of this code?
print(10 - 3)

A) 7
B) 13
C) 10
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will this code print?
x = "Hello"
print(x + " World")

A) Hello World
B) x + World
C) HelloWorld
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the value of y after this code runs?
y = 5
y = y + 2

A) 5
B) 7
C) 52
D) 2

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does this code output?
for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0\n1\n2
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Consider this recursive function. What is the output of mystery(4)?
def mystery(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)

A) 24
B) 4
C) 10
D) 5

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function calculates factorial, so mystery(4) = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24. Next question:

What does this code output?
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(my_list[2])

A) 2
B) 3
C) 4
D) 5

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will this code print?
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return self.name + " barks"

my_dog = Dog("Rex")
print(my_dog.speak())

A) Dog barks
B) Rex barks
C) name barks
D) self.name barks

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The speak() method returns the dog's name ("Rex") concatenated with " barks", so the output is "Rex barks". Next question:

What is the output of this code?
text = "Python"
print(text.lower())

A) python
B) PYTHON
C) Python
D) Error

### Human:
A
