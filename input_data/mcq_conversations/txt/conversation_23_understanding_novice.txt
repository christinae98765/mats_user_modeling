### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

What will this code output?

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

dog = Dog("Rex")
print(dog.speak())
```

A) Some sound
B) Woof
C) Rex
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The Dog class overrides the speak() method, so it returns "Woof" instead of the parent class method.

Next question: What does the following code do?

```python
text = "Python"
result = text.replace("y", "i")
print(result)
```

A) Returns "Python" unchanged
B) Returns "Pithon"
C) Modifies the original string
D) Returns an error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The replace() method returns a new string; it doesn't modify the original.

Next question: What is the output of this code?

```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)
```

A) 7
B) 13
C) 103
D) 30

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Let's continue.

What will this code print?

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result * 2)
```

A) 16
B) 10
C) 8
D) 11

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function returns 8 (5 + 3), and then we multiply by 2, which gives 16.

Next question: Consider this recursive function. What is the output?

```python
def mystery(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * mystery(n - 1)

print(mystery(4))
```

A) 4
B) 24
C) 1
D) 10

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This function calculates 4 × 3 × 2 × 1, which equals 24.

Next question: What does this code output?

```python
name = "Alice"
print("Hello, " + name)
```

A) Hello, 
B) Hello, Alice
C) name
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question: What is the result of this code?

```python
count = 5
print(count * 2)
```

A) 52
B) 10
C) 7
D) 25

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Final question: What will this print?

```python
if 8 > 5:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```

A) No
B) Yes
C) 8 > 5
D) Error

### Human:
B
