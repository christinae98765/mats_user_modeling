### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's begin with a question about functions.

What will this code output?

def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

print(greet("Alice"))

A) Hello, Alice
B) Hello, name
C) "Hello, Alice"
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Now for a harder question about recursion.

What does this recursive function return when called with factorial(4)?

def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

A) 24
B) 4
C) 10
D) 5

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is A - the function calculates 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24.

Next question about list methods.

What is the output of the following code?

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]
my_list.remove(2)
print(my_list)

A) [1, 3, 2, 4]
B) [1, 2, 3, 4]
C) [1, 3, 4]
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Now a basic question about variables and arithmetic.

What is the value of x after this code runs?

x = 10
x = x + 5
x = x * 2

A) 15
B) 30
C) 50
D) 25

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Let me trace it: x starts at 10, then x + 5 = 15, then 15 * 2 = 30. Wait, that is B. Correct.

Next question about while loops.

What does this code output?

count = 0
while count < 3:
    print(count)
    count += 1

A) 0 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2
C) 1 2 3
D) 0

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's a simple string question.

What is the output of this code?

text = "Python"
print(text[0])

A) P
B) 0
C) Python
D) t

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Now a question about dictionaries.

What will this code output?

student = {"name": "Bob", "age": 20, "grade": "A"}
print(student.get("age"))

A) Bob
B) 20
C) "age"
D) KeyError

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's a challenging question about classes and object-oriented programming.

What is the output of this code?

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def speak(self):
        return self.name + " makes a sound"

dog = Animal("Rex")
print(dog.speak())

A) Rex makes a sound
B) Animal makes a sound
C) dog makes a sound
D) speaks()

### Human:
D
