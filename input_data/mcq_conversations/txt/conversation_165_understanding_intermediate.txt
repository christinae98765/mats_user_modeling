### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

What will this code print?

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return self.name + " barks"

d = Dog("Rex")
print(d.speak())

A) Dog barks
B) Rex barks
C) Rex
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The instance name 'Rex' gets passed to the Dog class.

What is the output of this code?

x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 13
B) 7
C) 30
D) 103

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does this recursive function return when called with fib(4)?

def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

A) 3
B) 4
C) 5
D) 6

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Let me ask the next question:

What will this code output?

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_list.pop()
print(len(my_list))

A) 5
B) 4
C) 3
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's the next one:

What does the following function return?

def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

result = greet("Alice")
print(result)

A) Hello, Alice
B) Hello,Alice
C) greet
D) "Hello, Alice"

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Moving on:

What is the value of x after this code runs?

x = 5
x = x * 2
print(x)

A) 7
B) 10
C) 52
D) 25

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Consider this dictionary and nested access:

data = {"users": {"john": {"age": 30, "city": "NYC"}}}
print(data["users"]["john"]["age"])

What is the output?

A) {"age": 30, "city": "NYC"}
B) 30
C) john
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The nested keys drill down to the final value.

Final question:

What will this while loop output?

count = 0
while count < 3:
    print(count)
    count += 1

A) 0 1 2
B) 0 1 2 3
C) 1 2 3
D) 3

### Human:
A
