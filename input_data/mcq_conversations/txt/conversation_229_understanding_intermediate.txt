### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What is the output of the following code?
```python
name = "Alice"
print(name + " loves Python")
```
A) Alice loves Python
B) name loves Python
C) Alice + loves Python
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Consider this class definition:
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, species):
        self.species = species
    
    def sound(self):
        return "generic sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "woof"

dog = Dog("canine")
```

What is the value of `dog.species`?
A) "woof"
B) "canine"
C) "generic sound"
D) None

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B - `dog.species` is "canine" because it's set in the `__init__` method through inheritance.

Next question:

What does this function return?
```python
def process_list(items):
    result = []
    for item in items:
        if item % 2 == 0:
            result.append(item * 2)
    return result

process_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```
A) [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
B) [4, 8]
C) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
D) [2, 6, 10]

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the output of this code?
```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is 5 or less")
```
A) x is 5 or less
B) x is greater than 5
C) Error
D) Nothing is printed

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the output of this code?
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[1].upper())
```
A) banana
B) BANANA
C) APPLE
D) cherry

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Consider this function:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

result = fibonacci(4)
```

What is the value of `result`?
A) 2
B) 4
C) 5
D) 3

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is D - `fibonacci(4)` returns 3 (0, 1, 1, 2, 3 is the sequence).

Next question:

What is the output of this code?
```python
count = 0
for i in range(3):
    count = count + 1
print(count)
```
A) 2
B) 0
C) 3
D) 4

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will be printed?
```python
x = 5
y = 2
print(x * y - 3)
```
A) 7
B) 14
C) 10
D) 4

### Human:
A
