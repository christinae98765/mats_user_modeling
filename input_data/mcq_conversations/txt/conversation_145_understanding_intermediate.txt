### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What is the output of this code?
name = "Python"
print(name)

A) name
B) Python
C) "Python"
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Now let's try a harder one.

What will this code output?
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, species):
        self.species = species
    def info(self):
        return f"I am a {self.species}"

dog = Animal("dog")
print(dog.info())

A) I am a dog
B) Animal
C) dog
D) None

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is A - the info() method returns the formatted string "I am a dog".

Let's move on. What does this code do?
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = my_list[1:4]
print(result)

A) [1, 2, 3]
B) [2, 3, 4]
C) [2, 3, 4, 5]
D) [1, 2, 3, 4]

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the output of this code?
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 13
B) 7
C) 3
D) 10

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's the next one:

What will this code output?
text = "hello world"
print(text.upper())

A) hello world
B) HELLO WORLD
C) Hello World
D) H E L L O W O R L D

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the value of result after this code runs?
if 5 > 3:
    result = "yes"
else:
    result = "no"

A) no
B) yes
C) 5 > 3
D) True

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Let's try another challenging one:

What will this recursive function return when called with fib(4)?
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

A) 3
B) 4
C) 5
D) 2

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is A - fib(4) should return 3 (0, 1, 1, 2, 3 is the sequence).

Final question: What will this code output?
for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0
1
2
D) 3

### Human:
C
