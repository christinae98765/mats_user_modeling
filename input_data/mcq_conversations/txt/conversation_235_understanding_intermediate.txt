### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice.

What will this code output?

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} makes a sound"

dog = Animal("Rex")
print(dog.speak())

A) Rex makes a sound
B) Animal makes a sound
C) name makes a sound
D) Error: speak() missing required argument

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The instance variable `self.name` is set to "Rex", so it would print "Rex makes a sound". Let's move on.

Consider this recursive function:

def mystery(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)

What is mystery(5)?

A) 5
B) 120
C) 125
D) Error: maximum recursion depth exceeded

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This function calculates the factorial of n. For mystery(5), it would be 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.

What does this code print?

name = "Python"
print(name[0] + name[2])

A) Py
B) Pt
C) Po
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. name[0] is "P" and name[2] is "t", so the output is "Pt".

What will this function return when called with my_func([1, 2, 3, 4])?

def my_func(lst):
    total = 0
    for num in lst:
        total += num
    return total

A) 10
B) 4
C) 1
D) None

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. The function sums all elements: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.

What will be printed by this code?

data = {"a": [1, 2, 3], "b": {"x": 10, "y": 20}}
print(data["b"]["x"] + data["a"][1])

A) 12
B) 10
C) [1, 2, 3]
D) Error: unhashable type

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This code accesses nested dictionaries and lists correctly: data["b"]["x"] is 10, and data["a"][1] is 2, so the result is 12.

What is the output of this code?

text = "hello"
print(text.upper())

A) hello
B) HELLO
C) Hello
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. The upper() method converts the string to uppercase.

What will this code print?

x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y * 2)

A) 14
B) 4
C) 26
D) 7

### Human:
B
