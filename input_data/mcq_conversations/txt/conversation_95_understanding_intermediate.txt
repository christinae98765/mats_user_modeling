### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

What will this code print?
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 7
B) 13
C) 103
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Moving on.

Consider this recursive function:

def mystery(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)

What does mystery(4) return?

A) 10
B) 24
C) 64
D) 4

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function calculates factorial, so mystery(4) = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24.

Now for a medium question:

What does this code output?
text = "Python"
print(text.lower())

A) PYTHON
B) python
C) Python
D) pYTHON

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Look at this code:
data = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
for key in data:
    if data[key] > 1:
        data[key] = data[key] * 2
print(data)

What is printed?

A) {'a': 1, 'b': 4, 'c': 6}
B) {'a': 2, 'b': 4, 'c': 6}
C) {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The code only multiplies values greater than 1, so 'b' and 'c' get doubled (4 and 6), but 'a' stays 1.

Moving on:

What is the value of result after this code runs?
result = 0
for i in range(5):
    result = result + i

A) 10
B) 15
C) 20
D) 5

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next:

What does this function return?
def combine(a, b):
    return str(a) + str(b)

combine(5, 3)

A) 8
B) '53'
C) 53
D) '8'

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's another:

Which code snippet will cause an error?

A) x = [1, 2, 3]
print(x[0])

B) x = [1, 2, 3]
print(x[5])

C) x = [1, 2, 3]
print(len(x))

D) x = [1, 2, 3]
x.append(4)
print(x)

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Consider this nested structure:
matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
def process(m):
    result = []
    for row in m:
        for item in row:
            if item % 2 == 0:
                result.append(item)
    return result

What does process(matrix) return?

A) [2, 4, 6]
B) [1, 3, 5]
C) [2, 4, 5, 6]
D) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function collects all even numbers, which are 2, 4, and 6, so it returns [2, 4, 6].

Final question:

What does this print?
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print("Name: " + name + ", Age: " + str(age))

A) Name: Alice, Age: 25
B) NameAliceAge25
C) "Name: Alice, Age: 25"
D) Error

### Human:
A
