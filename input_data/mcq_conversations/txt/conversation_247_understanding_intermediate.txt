### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some Python questions.

What will this code print?
x = 10
y = 3
print(x + y)

A) 13
B) 103
C) Error
D) 30

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Let's move on.

Consider this function:

def mystery(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)

What does mystery(4) return?

A) 10
B) 24
C) 4
D) 256

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This is a recursive factorial function, so mystery(4) returns 24.

Let's continue:

What is the output of this code?
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
my_list.pop(1)
print(my_list)

A) [1, 3, 4]
B) [2, 3, 4]
C) [1, 2, 3]
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does the following code output?
text = "hello world"
print(text.upper())

A) Hello World
B) HELLO WORLD
C) hello world
D) HELLO world

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Moving on:

Consider this code with a dictionary:
student = {"name": "Alex", "age": 20, "grade": "A"}
student["age"] = 21
if "grade" in student:
    print("found")
else:
    print("not found")

What is printed?

A) found
B) not found
C) KeyError
D) 21

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The code checks if "grade" exists in the dictionary and prints "found".

Let's try another:

What will this output?
for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0\n1\n2
D) 3

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the result of this code?
x = 5
y = 10
result = x * 2 + y
print(result)

A) 20
B) 30
C) 70
D) 25

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's the next one:

What does this print?
name = "Python"
print("I love " + name)

A) I love Python
B) I love + Python
C) name
D) Error

### Human:
A
