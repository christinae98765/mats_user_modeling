C) 103
D) 30

### Human:

### Assistant:
Correct. Now let's try something more challenging:

What will this code output?
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

### Human:

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct answer is B - the instance name "Rex" is used.

Next question:

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 7)
print(result)

A) Prints 57
B) Prints 12
C) Prints "add_numbers"
D) Returns None

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Consider this recursive function:
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:

    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

What is factorial(4)?

A) 4
B) 16
C) 24
D) 10

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct answer is C - 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.
