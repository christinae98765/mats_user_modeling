### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's get started with some questions to practice your Python skills.

What will this function return?

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)

A) 8
B) "5 3"
C) 53
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Consider this code with a recursive function:

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

What is factorial(4)?

A) 10
B) 24
C) 16
D) 4

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is 24 (4 × 3 × 2 × 1). Let's continue.

Which list method adds a single element to the end of a list?

A) extend()
B) insert()
C) append()
D) add()

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will this code output?

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def speak(self):
        return "Some sound"

dog = Animal("Buddy")
print(dog.speak())

A) Buddy
B) Some sound
C) Animal
D) dog.speak()

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is "Some sound" because the speak() method returns that string. Moving on:

What does the string method upper() do?

A) Removes spaces from a string
B) Converts all characters to uppercase
C) Reverses the string
D) Counts the characters

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the output of this code?

my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
for key in my_dict:
    if my_dict[key] > 1:
        print(key)

A) a
B) b c
C) 1 2 3
D) c

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The loop prints both "b" and "c" since their values are greater than 1. Let's try another:

What is the output of this code?

x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 13
B) 7
C) 30
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Final question:

What will this code print?

name = "Python"
print(name + " is fun")

A) Python is fun
B) Pythonis fun
C) Python
D) is fun

### Human:
A
