### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What does the following function return?

def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

print(greet("Alice"))

A) Hello, Alice
B) Hello, name
C) name
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function concatenates the string "Hello, " with the parameter value. Let's move on.

What will this code output?

def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(4))

A) 24
B) 4
C) 16
D) 10

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This is a recursive function that multiplies numbers together. Next question:

Consider this code:

data = {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 25, 'scores': [85, 90, 78]}

What is the value of data['scores'][1]?

A) 85
B) 90
C) 78
D) 'scores'

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. You need to access the second element (index 1) of the scores list. Let's continue.

Which string method removes leading and trailing whitespace?

A) strip()
B) trim()
C) clean()
D) remove()

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the output of the following code?

x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 13
B) 7
C) 30
D) 103

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will this code display?

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for i in range(len(my_list)):
    if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:
        print(my_list[i])

A) 1 3 5
B) 2 4
C) 1 2 3 4 5
D) 4 5

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The code prints only the even numbers. Let's try the next one.

What is the output of this code?

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def bark(self):
        return self.name + " says woof!"

my_dog = Dog("Max")
print(my_dog.bark())

A) Max says woof!
B) Dog says woof!
C) woof!
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The method returns the dog's name followed by " says woof!". Final question:

What will print(5 * 2) output?

A) 52
B) 10
C) 7
D) 25

### Human:
B
