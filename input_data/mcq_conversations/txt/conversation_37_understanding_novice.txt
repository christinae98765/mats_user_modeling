### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What does the following code output?

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def bark(self):
        return self.name + " says woof"

d = Dog("Buddy")
print(d.bark())

A) Dog says woof
B) Buddy says woof
C) self.name says woof
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct answer is B. The instance variable 'name' stores "Buddy", so the method returns "Buddy says woof". Let's move on.

What is the output of print("Hello" + " " + "World")?
A) Hello World
B) HelloWorld
C) "Hello World"
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Consider this recursive function:

def mystery(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)

What is mystery(4)?

A) 4
B) 10
C) 24
D) 256

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct answer is C. This function calculates factorial: 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.

Consider this code:

my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]
my_list.append(50)
print(len(my_list))

What is the output?

A) 4
B) 5
C) 50
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct answer is B. The append() method adds 50 to the list, making it 5 elements long.

What is the output of print(10 % 3)?
A) 3
B) 1
C) 2
D) 3.33

### Human:

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will print(len("Python")) output?
A) 6
B) Python
C) 5
D) Error

### Human:

Consider this code:

def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):
