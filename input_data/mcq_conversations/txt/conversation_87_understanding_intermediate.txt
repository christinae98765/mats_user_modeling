C) Prints: 3
D) Prints: 0, 1, 2, 3

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Let's move to the next level.

D) d = ("name", "John"); print(d["name"])

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is C, but let me clarify the other options for context.

Now for a harder question about recursion:

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

What does factorial(4) return?

A) 10
B) 16
C) 24
D) 4

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct answer is C (24).

Here's our final question about error handling:

Which approach correctly handles a potential division by zero error?

A) try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    result = 0

B) if 0 != 0:
    result = 10 / 0

C) result = 10 / 0 or 0

D) catch ZeroDivisionError:
    result = 0

### Human:
D
