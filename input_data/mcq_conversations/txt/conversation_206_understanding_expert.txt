Of course! Let's start with some questions.

What will this code print?
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 7
B) 13
C) 103

Correct. Next question.

Consider this code:
class Counter:
    def __init__(self, start=0):
        self.value = start
    def increment(self):
        self.value += 1
        return self.value

c = Counter(5)
result = c.increment()
print(result)

What is printed?
A) 5
B) 6
C) None
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.

What does this function return?
def process(items):
    total = 0
    for item in items:
        total += item
    return total

result = process([2, 4, 6])
print(result)

A) [2, 4, 6]
B) 12
C) 2
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.

What is the output?
text = "hello world"
print(text.upper())

A) hello world
B) Hello World
C) HELLO WORLD
D) HELLO world

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.

What will this recursive function return?
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(5))

A) 5
B) 8
C) 3
D) 13

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B - fibonacci(5) returns 5, but let me clarify: fibonacci(5) actually equals 5 in the sequence. However, the recursive calculation returns 5. Let me move to the next question.

What does this code output?
mylist = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(mylist[2])

A) 1
B) 2
C) 3
D) 4

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.
