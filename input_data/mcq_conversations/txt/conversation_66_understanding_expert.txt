class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

dog = Dog("Rex")
print(dog.speak())
```
What is the output?
A) Some sound
B) Woof
C) Rex
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does the following code return?
```python
def process(items):
    result = []
    for item in items:
        if item > 5:
            result.append(item * 2)
    return result

process([3, 6, 8, 2])
```
A) [3, 6, 8, 2]
B) [12, 16]
C) [6, 12, 16]
D) [6, 8]
