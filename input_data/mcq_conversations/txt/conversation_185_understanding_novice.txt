### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

What will this code output?

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def bark(self):
        return self.name + ' says woof'

d = Dog('Rex')
print(d.bark())

A) Dog says woof
B) Rex says woof
C) name says woof
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The instance variable 'name' stores 'Rex', so it would print 'Rex says woof'.

Let's continue. What is the output of this recursive function?

def countdown(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 'Done'
    else:
        return countdown(n - 1)

print(countdown(3))

A) 3 2 1 Done
B) Done
C) None
D) Error - stack overflow

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function recursively calls itself until n reaches 0, then returns 'Done'.

Here's the next question. What does this code do?

def process_list(items):
    result = []
    for item in items:
        if len(item) > 2:
            result.append(item.upper())
    return result

print(process_list(['hi', 'hello', 'bye', 'python']))

A) ['HI', 'HELLO', 'BYE', 'PYTHON']
B) ['HELLO', 'PYTHON']
C) ['hi', 'hello', 'bye', 'python']
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The code only appends items with more than 2 characters, so 'hi' and 'bye' are filtered out.

Let's try this one. What will print?

x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)

A) xy
B) 15
C) 510
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Moving on.

Consider this code with a dictionary:

def get_value(d):
    try:
        return d['key']
    except KeyError:
        return 'Not found'

my_dict = {'name': 'Alice'}
print(get_value(my_dict))

A) Alice
B) Not found
C) KeyError
D) 'key'

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The dictionary doesn't have a 'key' entry, so the KeyError exception is caught and 'Not found' is returned.

What is the output of this code?

name = 'Python'
print(name[1:4])

A) Pyt
B) yth
C) yth
D) Python

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Last question.

What does this print?

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2 3
C) 0\n1\n2
D) 3

### Human:
C
