### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

A) 10
B) 52
C) 7
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will this function return?
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
result = add(3, 4)

A) Nothing
B) 7
C) 34
D) x + y

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function returns the sum of the two numbers. Next question:

What is the output of this code?
name = "Python"
print(name[0])

A) Python

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Which method removes whitespace from both ends of a string?

C) trim()
D) clean()

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct method is strip(). Next question:

What does this recursive function do?
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

A) Returns n squared
B) Returns the factorial of n
C) Returns n divided by 2
D) Causes infinite recursion

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This function calculates the factorial of n. Next question:

What will this code output?
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def bark(self):
        return self.name + " says woof"

d = Dog("Rex")
print(d.bark())

A) Dog says woof
B) Rex says woof
C) name says woof
D) Error

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The code creates an object and calls the method, which returns "Rex says woof". Next question:

What is the value of x after this code?
try:
    x = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    x = 5

A) 10
B) 0
C) 5
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The division by zero triggers the exception handler, so x is assigned 5. Next question:
