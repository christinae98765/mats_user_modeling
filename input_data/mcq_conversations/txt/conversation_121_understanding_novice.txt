### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions.

What does the following function return?

def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

print(greet("Alice"))

A) Hello, Alice
B) Hello, name
C) "Hello, " + "Alice"
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function concatenates the strings and returns the result. Next question:

What is the output of the following code?

x = 10
y = 5
print(x - y)

A) 15
B) 5
C) 105
D) 50

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Moving on:

Which of these is a valid way to create a string in Python?

A) my_string = ["Hello"]
B) my_string = "Hello"
C) my_string = {"Hello"}
D) my_string = <"Hello">

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Consider this code. What will be printed?

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def speak(self):
        return self.name + " makes a sound"

dog = Animal("Rex")
print(dog.speak())

A) dog makes a sound
B) Rex makes a sound
C) self.name makes a sound
D) Error: __init__ is not defined

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. When you create the Animal object with "Rex", that becomes the name attribute. Next question:

What does the list method .append() do?

A) Removes the last item from a list
B) Returns the length of a list
C) Adds an item to the end of a list
D) Sorts a list in alphabetical order

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The .append() method adds items, not sorts them. Next question:

What is the output of this recursive function?

def count_down(n):
    if n == 0:
        return "Done"
    else:
        return count_down(n - 1)

print(count_down(3))

A) 3
B) 0
C) Done
D) Error: maximum recursion depth exceeded

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function keeps calling itself until n reaches 0, then returns "Done". Final question:

What will this code output?

data = {"name": "John", "age": 25, "city": "NYC"}
print(data["age"] + 5)

A) age5
B) 30
C) "age25"
D) Error: cannot add int and string

### Human:
A
