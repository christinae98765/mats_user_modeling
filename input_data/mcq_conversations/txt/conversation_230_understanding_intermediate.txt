### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What is the output of this code?
```python
x = 10
y = 5
print(x + y)
```
A) 15
B) 105
C) 10
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Consider this recursive function. What does it return when called with f(4)?
```python
def f(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * f(n - 1)
```
A) 10
B) 24
C) 16
D) 8

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function calculates factorial, so f(4) = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.

Next question:

Given this dictionary and code, what is the output?
```python
student = {'name': 'Alice', 'grade': 'A', 'age': 20}
student['grade'] = 'B'
print(student['grade'])
```
A) 'A'
B) 'B'
C) KeyError
D) None

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The grade was reassigned to 'B', so the output is 'B'.

Next question:

What does this code print?
```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
```
A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0\n1\n2
D) 3

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Which of these correctly implements a class that stores a person's name and has a method to get their name in uppercase?
A) class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def get_upper_name(self):
        return name.upper()

B) class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def get_upper_name(self):
        return self.name.upper()

C) class Person:
    def __init__(name):
        self.name = name
    def get_upper_name(self):
        return self.name.upper()

D) class Person:
    name = ""
    def get_upper_name():
        return self.name.upper()

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Option B is correct because you need `self.name` inside the method to reference the instance variable.

Next question:

What is the output of this code?
```python
def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

result = multiply(4, 5)
print(result)
```
A) 20
B) 45
C) 9
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does the following code output?
```python
text = "python"
print(text.upper())
```
A) PYTHON
B) python
C) Python
D) pYTHON

### Human:
A
