### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions.

What will this code output?

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} barks"

d = Dog("Rex")
print(d.speak())

A) name barks
B) Rex barks
C) Dog barks
D) Error: speak() missing argument

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct answer is B - the method uses the instance's name attribute.

Next question: Consider this recursive function:

def mystery(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)

print(mystery(5))

A) 5
B) 15
C) 120
D) RecursionError

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct answer is C - this function calculates factorial, so 5! = 120.

Next question: What does this code output?

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = [x * 2 for x in my_list if x > 2]
print(result)

A) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
B) [6, 8, 10]
C) [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
D) [4, 6, 8]

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question: Which code correctly reads a file and handles errors?

A) with open('data.txt') as f:
    data = f.read()
    print(data)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print('File not found')

B) try:
    with open('data.txt') as f:
        data = f.read()
    print(data)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print('File not found')

C) open('data.txt')
data = f.read()

D) f = open('data.txt', 'w')
data = f.read()

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct answer is B - the try block must come before except, and you need to properly assign the file object.

Next question: What is the output of this code?

x = 10
y = 20
print(x + y)

A) 1020
B) 30
C) xy
D) 200

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question: What will this code output?

text = "hello world"
print(text.replace('world', 'Python'))

A) hello Python
B) hello world
C) helloworld
D) Error: replace not defined

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question: What is the output of this code?

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0
1
2
D) 1 2

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. What will this function return?

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(7, 5)
print(result)

A) 12
B) add_numbers(7, 5)
C) 75
D) Error

### Human:
A
