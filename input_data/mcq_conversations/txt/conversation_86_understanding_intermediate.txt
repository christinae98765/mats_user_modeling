### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's get started with our first question.

Consider this code:
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

dog = Dog("Rex")
print(dog.speak())
```
What is the output?
A) Some sound
B) Woof
C) None
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The Dog class overrides the speak method, so it returns "Woof". Let's continue.

What will this code output?
```python
def process(items):
    result = []
    for item in items:
        result.append(item * 2)
    return result

print(process([1, 2, 3]))
```
A) [2, 4, 6]
B) [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
C) 2
D) [2, 2, 2]

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. The function doubles each element in the list.

What does the following code output?
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(4))
```
A) 2
B) 4
C) 3
D) 5

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. fibonacci(4) = fibonacci(3) + fibonacci(2) = 2 + 1 = 3, which is actually correct. Let me clarify - the answer is C, which is 3. Moving on.

Consider this dictionary operation:
```python
data = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
nested = {'x': data, 'y': {'d': 4}}
print(nested['x']['b'])
```
What is printed?
A) {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
B) 2
C) 'b'
D) KeyError

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. nested['x'] gives you the entire dictionary {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}, but then ['b'] accesses the value 2. Let's move forward.

Which of these correctly uses a while loop to print numbers 1 through 3?
A) while True: print(1, 2, 3)
B) i = 1; while i <= 3: print(i); i += 1
C) while i in range(1, 4): print(i)
D) while 1 <= 3: print(1)

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. That while loop properly initializes, checks the condition, and increments the variable.

What is the output of this code?
```python
text = "hello"
print(text.upper())
```
A) HELLO
B) Hello
C) hello
D) ERROR

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. The upper() method converts a string to uppercase.

What will this code print?
```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
```
A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0\n1\n2
D) 3

### Human:
C
