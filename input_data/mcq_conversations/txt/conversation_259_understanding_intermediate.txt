### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

Consider this code:
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

d = Dog("Rex")
print(d.speak())
```
What is the output?
A) Some sound
B) Woof
C) Rex
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The Dog class overrides the speak() method, so it returns "Woof".

Next question: What does this print?
```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)
```
A) 7
B) 13
C) 103
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Now for the next one:

What is the output of this code?
```python
text = "hello"
print(text.upper())
```
A) hello
B) HELLO
C) Hello
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's a harder question:

What does this recursive function return when called with fib(4)?
```python
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
A) 2
B) 3
C) 4
D) 5

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. fib(4) = fib(3) + fib(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.

Next question:

Consider this code with nested dictionaries:
```python
data = {"user": {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}}
print(data["user"]["name"])
```
What is the output?
A) user
B) Alice
C) {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. You need to access the nested dictionary first with "user", then access "name" from that dictionary, which gives "Alice".

Next question: What is the value of x after this code runs?
```python
x = 5
x = x + 2
print(x)
```
A) 5
B) 7
C) 25
D) 52

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does this code output?
```python
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

print(greet("Bob"))
```
A) greet
B) Hello, Bob
C) Bob
D) Hello, name

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's the final question:

What is printed by this code?
```python
def process(lst):
    result = {}
    for i, val in enumerate(lst):
        result[i] = val ** 2
    return result

print(process([1, 2, 3]))
```
A) {0: 1, 1: 4, 2: 9}
B) [1, 4, 9]
C) {0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 3}
D) Error

### Human:
B
