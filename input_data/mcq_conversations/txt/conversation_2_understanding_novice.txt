### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

What will this code output?

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def bark(self):
        return self.name + ' says woof'

d = Dog('Buddy')
print(d.bark())

A) Buddy says woof
B) Dog says woof
C) self.name says woof
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The instance name 'Buddy' gets stored in self.name, so it would output 'Buddy says woof'.

Let's try another. What does this recursive function return when called with mystery(5)?

def mystery(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)

A) 5
B) 120
C) 25
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This function calculates factorial, so mystery(5) = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.

Let's try an easier one. What is the output of this code?

x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 13
B) 7
C) 103
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct.

Now, consider this code with a nested dictionary:

student = {
    'name': 'Alice',
    'grades': {'math': 95, 'english': 87}
}

What does student['grades']['math'] return?

A) 'Alice'
B) {'math': 95, 'english': 87}
C) 95
D) KeyError

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. You need to access the nested value with both keys. student['grades'] gives you the dictionary, and ['math'] accesses the value inside it, which is 95.

Here's another question. What does this code do?

text = 'python'
print(text.upper())

A) python
B) PYTHON
C) Python
D) Error

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The upper() method converts the string to uppercase, so it returns 'PYTHON'.

Let's move on. What will print(5 * 2) output?

A) 52
B) 10
C) 25
D) 7

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct.

Last question. What is the output of this code?

data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
try:
    print(data[10])
except IndexError:
    print('Index out of range')

A) None
B) Index out of range
C) IndexError
D) 5

### Human:
C
