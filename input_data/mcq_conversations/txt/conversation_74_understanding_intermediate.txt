### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions to practice your Python skills.

What will this function return when called with greet('Alice')?

def greet(name):
    return 'Hello, ' + name

A) Hello, Alice
B) greet('Alice')
C) 'Hello, ' + name
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the output of the following code?
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 13
B) 7
C) 3
D) 103

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does the following code output?
word = 'python'
print(word.upper())

A) python
B) Python
C) PYTHON
D) pYTHON

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will be the result of executing this code?
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
my_list.append(5)
print(len(my_list))

A) 4
B) 5
C) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
D) 6

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Consider this recursive function:

def countdown(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    return n + countdown(n - 1)

What is countdown(3)?

A) 3
B) 6
C) 12
D) 9

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds n to the recursive call, so countdown(3) = 3 + countdown(2) = 3 + 2 + countdown(1) = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6. Next question:

What will this code output?

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def bark(self):
        return self.name + ' says woof!'

dog = Dog('Buddy')
print(dog.bark())

A) Buddy says woof!
B) Dog says woof!
C) bark()
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct answer is A - the method bark() returns a string that includes the dog's name. Next question:

What is the output of this code?
for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0, 1, 2 (on separate lines)
D) 3

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does the following dictionary code output?

student = {'name': 'John', 'age': 20, 'grades': [85, 90, 88]}
print(student['grades'][1])
