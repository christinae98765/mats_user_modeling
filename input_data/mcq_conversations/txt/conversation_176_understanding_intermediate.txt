### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

Question 1: What will this code output?
```python
class Counter:
    def __init__(self, start=0):
        self.value = start
    def increment(self):
        self.value += 1
        return self.value

c = Counter(5)
print(c.increment())
print(c.increment())
```
A) 5, 6
B) 6, 7
C) 5, 5
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The increment method modifies the value and returns it, so it outputs 6, then 7.

Question 2: Consider this recursive function. What is the output of mystery(3)?
```python
def mystery(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)

print(mystery(3))
```
A) 3
B) 6
C) 1
D) 24

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This function calculates factorial: 3 * 2 * 1 = 6... wait, actually 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 is incorrect. Let me clarify: 3 * mystery(2) = 3 * (2 * mystery(1)) = 3 * (2 * 1) = 6. The answer is 6, which you selected—that's correct.

Question 3: What is the output of the following code?
```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y * 2)
```
A) 14
B) 4
C) 20
D) 13

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Multiplication happens before subtraction, so 10 - (3 * 2) = 4.

Question 4: What does this code do?
```python
def process_list(items):
    result = []
    for item in items:
        if item % 2 == 0:
            result.append(item * 2)
    return result

print(process_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
```
A) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
B) [4, 8]
C) [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
D) [2, 4, 6]

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. The function filters for even numbers and doubles them: 2*2=4, 4*2=8.

Question 5: What is the output of this code?
```python
text = "python"
print(text.upper())
```
A) python
B) PYTHON
C) Python
D) pYTHON

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. The upper() method converts all characters to uppercase.

Question 6: What will this code output?
```python
def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):
    return greeting + ", " + name

print(greet("Alice", "Hi"))
```
A) Hello, Alice
B) Hi, Alice
C) greet
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. The function uses the provided greeting "Hi" instead of the default "Hello".

Question 7: What does this code do?
```python
data = {"name": "Bob", "age": 25, "city": "NYC"}
print(data.get("age"))
```
A) Error
B) 25
C) "age"
D) None

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. The get() method retrieves the value associated with the key "age".

Question 8: What is the output of this code?
```python
lines = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
result = ", ".join(lines)
print(result)
```
A) ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
B) apple banana cherry
C) apple, banana, cherry
D) apple,banana,cherry

### Human:
C
