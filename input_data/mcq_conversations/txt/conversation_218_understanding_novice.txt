Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions to practice your Python skills.

What does the following function return?

def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

print(greet("Alice"))

A) Hello, Alice
B) greet
C) "Hello, " + "Alice"
D) None

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function concatenates the strings and returns the result. Let's move on.

What is the output of this code?

x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 13
B) 7
C) 103
D) 30

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Which string method converts all characters to uppercase?

A) .upper()
B) .capitalize()
C) .uppercase()
D) .toUpper()

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct method is .upper().

Consider this code:

my_dict = {"apple": 5, "banana": 3, "orange": 7}
print(my_dict["banana"] + my_dict["apple"])

What is the output?

A) apple banana
B) 8
C) "banana" + "apple"
D) KeyError

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The output is 8 because we're accessing the values and adding them together.

What will this code print?

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2
C) range(3)
D) 3

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. range(3) produces 0, 1, 2.

What does this recursive function return when called with fib(4)?

def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

A) 1
B) 2
C) 3
D) 4

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. fib(4) returns 3.

Which of the following correctly defines a class in Python?
