### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions.

What will this code output?
```python
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name
print(greet("Alice"))
```
A) Hello, Alice
B) greet("Alice")
C) None
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will this recursive function return when called with n=3?
```python
def mystery(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)
```
A) 3
B) 6
C) 9
D) 1

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function calculates factorial: 3 * 2 * 1 = 6. Let's move on.

What does this code output?
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(my_list[2])
```
A) 1
B) 2
C) 3
D) 4

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Which code correctly creates and accesses a dictionary value?
```python
student = {"name": "Bob", "grade": 95}
```
What does print(student.get("age", "Not found")) output?
A) None
B) Not found
C) 95
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The .get() method with a default value returns "Not found" when the key doesn't exist. Let's continue.

What is the output of this code?
```python
text = "Python"
print(text.lower())
```
A) PYTHON
B) python
C) Python
D) pYTHON

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Consider this class:
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
```
What will this code output?
```python
dog = Animal("Rex")
print(dog.name)
```
A) Animal
B) None
C) Rex
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The instance stores "Rex" in the name attribute. Moving forward.

What is the output of this code?
```python
x = 10
y = 5
print(x - y)
```
A) 15
B) 5
C) 50
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Last question:

What will this print?
```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
```
A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0\n1\n2
D) 3
