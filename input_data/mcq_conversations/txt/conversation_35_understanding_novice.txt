### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

Question 1: What will this code print?

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} makes a sound"

dog = Animal("Rex")
print(dog.speak())

A) dog makes a sound
B) Rex makes a sound
C) Animal makes a sound
D) Error: speak() is not defined

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct answer is B - the name 'Rex' is stored in the object, so it prints "Rex makes a sound".

Question 2: What does the split() method do in Python?

sentence = "Hello world Python"
words = sentence.split()

A) Joins the string with spaces
B) Splits the string into a list of words
C) Converts the string to uppercase
D) Removes all spaces from the string

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct answer is B - split() breaks a string into a list of words.

Question 3: What is the output of this code?

x = 10
y = 5
print(x + y)

A) 105
B) 15
C) 10 5
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct.

Question 4: What will print("Hello" + " " + "World") output?

A) Hello World
B) HelloWorld
C) Hello + World
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct.

Question 5: What does the len() function return when used on a list?

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(len(my_list))

A) The last element in the list
B) The sum of all elements
C) The number of elements in the list
D) The first element in the list

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct answer is C - len() returns the number of elements in the list, which would be 5.

Question 6: What is the output of this code?

def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

result = greet("Alice")
print(result)

A) Alice
B) Hello, Alice
C) greet("Alice")
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct answer is B - the function returns "Hello, " concatenated with "Alice", so it prints "Hello, Alice".

Question 7: What will this code output?

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0\n1\n2 (each on a new line)
D) 3

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct answer is C - range(3) starts at 0 and goes up to (but not including) 3, so it prints 0, 1, 2 each on a new line.

Question 8: What does this recursive function return when called with fib(4)?

def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

A) 3
B) 4
C) 5
D) 2

### Human:
D
