### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What is the output of this code?
name = "Alice"
print(name + " loves Python")

A) Alice loves Python
B) name + " loves Python"
C) Alice
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Now let's try something harder.

Consider this recursive function:
def countdown(n):
    if n == 0:
        return "Done"
    return str(n) + ", " + countdown(n - 1)

What does countdown(3) return?

A) "3, 2, 1, Done"
B) "3, 2, 1, 0"
C) "1, 2, 3"
D) RecursionError

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function returns a string that builds up as the recursion unwinds, resulting in "3, 2, 1, Done". Let's move on.

Which string method removes leading and trailing whitespace?

A) remove()
B) strip()
C) clean()
D) trim()

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does this code output?
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    if fruit.startswith("b"):
        print(fruit.upper())

A) apple banana cherry
B) BANANA
C) banana
D) No output

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next:

What is the value of x after this code runs?
x = 10
x = x + 5

A) 10
B) 15
C) 5
D) 105

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Moving on:

Which of these creates a list with three elements?

A) my_list = (1, 2, 3)
B) my_list = "1, 2, 3"
C) my_list = [1, 2, 3]
D) my_list = {1, 2, 3}

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's the next one:

What does this code output?
def process(items):
    result = []
    for item in items:
        result.append(item * 2)
    return result

print(process([1, 2, 3]))

A) [1, 2, 3]
B) [2, 4, 6]
C) 6
D) [1, 4, 6]

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Final question:

Consider this code with nested dictionaries:
data = {"users": {"alice": {"age": 30}, "bob": {"age": 25}}}

What does data["users"]["alice"]["age"] return?

A) "alice"
B) 25
C) 30
D) KeyError

### Human:
D
