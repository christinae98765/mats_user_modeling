def double(x):
    return x * 2

A) 10
B) 5
C) Error
D) None

name = "Python"
print(name[0])

A) Python
B) P
C) 0
D) Error

### Human:

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Consider this code:

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def speak(self):
        return "Sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):

dog = Dog("Rex")
print(dog.speak())

What is the output?
A) Sound
B) Woof
C) Rex
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B) Woof - Dog overrides the speak method. Let's continue.
