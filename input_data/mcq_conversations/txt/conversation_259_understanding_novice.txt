### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What does the following code output?

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

d = Dog("Rex")
print(d.speak())
```

A) Sound
B) Woof
C) Rex
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The Dog class overrides the speak() method, so it returns "Woof". Next question:

What is the output of the following code?

```python
text = "python"
print(text.upper())
```

A) PYTHON
B) python
C) Python
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The upper() method converts all characters to uppercase, resulting in "PYTHON". Next question:

Consider this code:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
my_list.append(5)
print(my_list[2])
```

What is printed?

A) 2
B) 3
C) 4
D) 5

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. After appending 5, the list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Index 2 refers to the third element, which is 3. Next question:

What is the output of this code?

```python
x = 10
y = 5
print(x - y)
```

A) 15
B) 5
C) 50
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will this code output?

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(4))
```

A) 24
B) 4
C) 64
D) Error

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function calculates 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24. Next question:

What is the output of this code?

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(name + " is " + str(age))
```

A) name is age
B) Alice is 25
C) Alice25
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the output of this code?

```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
```

A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0\n1\n2
D) 3

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the output of this code?

```python
if 5 > 3:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```

A) Yes
B) No
C) Error
D) 5

### Human:
A
