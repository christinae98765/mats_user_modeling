### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions to test your Python knowledge.

What will this code output?
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 7
B) 13
C) 103
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Now let's try a function question.

What is the output of this code?
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

print(greet("Alice"))

A) Hello, Alice Alice
B) Hello, Alice
C) Alice
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's a harder question about recursion.

What will this function return when called with f(4)?
def f(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * f(n - 1)

A) 4
B) 10
C) 24
D) 120

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function calculates factorial, so f(4) = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24.

Let's move on. What does this code output?
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(my_list[2])

A) 1
B) 2
C) 3
D) 4

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.

What is the output of this code?
for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0\n1\n2
D) 3

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Now for a class-based question.

What will this code output?
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return self.name + " barks"

d = Dog("Rex")
print(d.speak())

A) Dog barks
B) Rex barks
C) name barks
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The output would be "Rex barks" because we created a Dog object with name "Rex".

Let's continue. What is the output of this code?
text = "Python"
print(text[0])

A) P
B) y
C) 0
D) Python

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Last question.

What does this code output?
text = "hello"
print(text.upper())

A) HELLO
B) hello
C) Hello
D) Error

### Human:
A
