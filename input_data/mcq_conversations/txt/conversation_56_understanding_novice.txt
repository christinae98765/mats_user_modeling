### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What will this code output?

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Some sound"

dog = Animal("Rex")
print(dog.speak())
```

A) Rex
B) Some sound
C) dog
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B. The speak() method returns the string "Some sound". Let's continue.

What does the append() method do to a list?

A) Removes the last element
B) Adds an element to the end of the list
C) Sorts the list in alphabetical order
D) Returns the first element

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Not quite. The answer is B. The append() method adds an element to the end of a list. Next question:

Which of these correctly defines a recursive function that counts down from n to 0?

A) def countdown(n):
    if n == 0:
        return
    print(n)
    countdown(n - 1)

B) def countdown(n):
    print(n)

C) def countdown(n):
    countdown(n - 1)

D) def countdown(n):
    while n > 0:
        print(n)
        n -= 1

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is A. Option A correctly uses recursion with a base case to count down. Moving on:

What will this code print?

```python
text = "hello world"
print(text.upper())
```

A) hello world
B) Hello World
C) HELLO WORLD
D) hello WORLD

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is C. The upper() method converts all characters to uppercase. Let's try another:

What is the output of this code?

```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x + y)
```

A) 13
B) 103
C) 30
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Moving on:

Which code correctly creates and uses a dictionary?

A) my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
   print(my_dict["name"])

B) my_dict = ["name", "Alice", "age", 25]
   print(my_dict[0])

C) my_dict = ("name": "Alice")
   print(my_dict)

D) my_dict = {"name": "Alice"}
   print(my_dict.get(0))

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is A. Option A correctly creates a dictionary and accesses the value using the key. Next question:

What will be printed?

```python
name = "Python"
print(name[0])
```

A) P
B) Python
C) 0
D) n

### Human:
A
