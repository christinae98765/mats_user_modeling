### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

What is the output of this code?
name = "Alice"
print(name + " is here")

A) Alice is here
B) name + " is here"
C) Alice
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does the following function return?
def double(x):
    return x * 2
result = double(5)

A) 25
B) 10
C) 5
D) "5 * 2"

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Which of the following correctly creates a dictionary and accesses a value?

A) my_dict = {"name": "Bob", "age": 30}; print(my_dict["name"]) outputs Bob
B) my_dict = ["name": "Bob", "age": 30]; print(my_dict.name) outputs Bob
C) my_dict = {"name": "Bob", "age": 30}; print(my_dict.get("name")) outputs ["name"]
D) my_dict = ("name": "Bob", "age": 30); print(my_dict[0]) outputs "name"

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is A - my_dict["name"] correctly returns "Bob". Next question:

Which code snippet correctly removes duplicates from a list?

A) my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3]; new_list = list(set(my_list))
B) my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3]; new_list = my_list.remove_duplicates()
C) my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3]; new_list = my_list.unique()
D) my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3]; new_list = [x for x in my_list if x == my_list[0]]

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the output of this code?
for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2
C) 3
D) 0 1 2 3

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What value does x have after this code runs?
x = 10
if x > 5:
    x = x - 3
else:
    x = x + 5

A) 7
B) 15
C) 10
D) 5

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Which code correctly implements a recursive function to calculate factorial?

A) def factorial(n): return n * factorial(n-1)
B) def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n-1)
C) def factorial(n): factorial(n-1) * n
D) def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    return factorial(n-1)

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B - it includes the base case (if n == 0) which is essential to stop the recursion. Next question:

What does the following code output?
text = "Python"
print(text.lower())

A) PYTHON
B) python
C) Python
D) Error

### Human:
B
