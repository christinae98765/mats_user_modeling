### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's get started with some practice questions.

Consider this code:
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

d = Dog("Rex")
print(d.speak())
```
What is the output?
A) Some sound
B) Woof
C) Rex
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The Dog class overrides the speak() method, so it returns "Woof" instead.

Next question: What does the following code output?
```python
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

result = greet("Alice")
print(result)
```
A) Hello, Alice
B) greet
C) name
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question: What is the output of the following code?
```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)
```
A) 13
B) 7
C) 3
D) 10

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question: What does this recursive function return when called with fact(4)?
```python
def fact(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * fact(n - 1)

print(fact(4))
```
A) 4
B) 10
C) 24
D) 16

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function calculates 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, which equals 24.

Next question: What is the output of this code?
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(my_list[2])
```
A) 1
B) 2
C) 3
D) 5

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question: What does this code print?
```python
my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
for key in my_dict:
    if my_dict[key] > 1:
        print(key)
```
A) b c
B) a
C) 1 2 3
D) b\nc

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The loop prints only the keys where the value is greater than 1, which are "b" and "c" on separate lines.

Next question: What is the output of the following code?
```python
sentence = "python"
print(sentence.upper())
```
A) PYTHON
B) python
C) Python
D) PYTHON()

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Last question: What is the output of this code?
```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
```
A) 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2
C) 3
D) 0

### Human:
B
