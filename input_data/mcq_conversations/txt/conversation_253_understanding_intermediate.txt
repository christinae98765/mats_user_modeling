### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

What is the output of the following code?
print("Hello" + " " + "World")
A) Hello World
B) HelloWorld
C) Hello + World
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Let's move to the next question.

Consider this recursive function:
def count_down(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    return n + count_down(n - 1)

What does count_down(4) return?
A) 10
B) 4
C) 24
D) 1

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function sums all values from 4 down to 1, returning 10.

Now, what does the following code output?
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
for i in range(len(my_list)):
    my_list[i] = my_list[i] * 2
print(my_list)
A) [2, 4, 6, 8]
B) [1, 2, 3, 4]
C) [2, 4, 6, 8, 2, 4, 6, 8]
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.

What is the output of this code?
data = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "Boston"}
data["age"] = 26
print(data.get("age"))
A) 25
B) 26
C) KeyError
D) None

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The dictionary was modified and get() returns 26 without raising an error.

Consider this code with nested structures:
matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
result = [row[1] for row in matrix if row[0] > 2]
print(result)
A) [1, 2, 3, 4]
B) [4, 6]
C) [3, 5]
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The list comprehension filters rows where the first element is greater than 2, so it returns [4, 6].

What is the output of this code?
def process_string(text):
    return text.upper().replace("A", "@")

print(process_string("banana"))
A) BANANA
B) B@N@N@
C) banana
D) @b@n@n@

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Let's continue.

What does this while loop print?
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print(count, end=" ")
    count += 1
A) 0 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2
C) 1 2 3
D) 3 2 1

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. One more question.

What is the value of x after this code runs?
x = 10
if x > 5:
    x = x + 2
else:
    x = x - 2
print(x)
A) 8
B) 10
C) 12
D) 5

### Human:
C
