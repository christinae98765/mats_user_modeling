### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions to practice your Python skills.

What will this code output?
print("Hello" + " " + "World")
A) Hello World
B) HelloWorld
C) "Hello World"
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Now let's move on.

What does the following function return?
def greet(name):
    return "Hi, " + name

print(greet("Alice"))
A) greet("Alice")
B) Hi, Alice
C) "Hi, Alice"
D) None

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.

What is the value of x after this code runs?
x = 10
x = x + 5
A) 10
B) 15
C) 5
D) 105

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Let's continue.

Which of these is a valid variable name in Python?
A) 2var
B) var-name
C) var_name
D) var name

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Moving forward.

What will this loop print?
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
A) 0 1 2 3
B) 1 2 3
C) 0 1 2
D) 3

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Now a harder question.

Consider this recursive function. What does it return?
def mystery(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)

mystery(4)
A) 10
B) 4
C) 24
D) 4

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is C (24) - this calculates factorial.

Here's another difficult one.

Which code correctly creates and accesses a dictionary?
A) dict = [name: "John", age: 25]; print(dict["name"])
B) dict = {"name": "John", "age": 25}; print(dict[name])
C) dict = {"name": "John", "age": 25}; print(dict["name"])
D) dict = {name: John, age: 25}; print(dict["name"])

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is C - you need quotes around the key in dictionary access.

Let's try another question.

What will this code output?
words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(words[1].upper())
A) banana
B) BANANA
C) ["BANANA"]
D) Error

### Human:
B
