### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! I'd be happy to help you practice Python. Let's get started with our first question.

What does the following function return?

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)

A) 8
B) 5
C) 3
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function returns the sum of both parameters. Let's move to the next question.

Which string method converts text to uppercase?

A) upper_case()
B) uppercase()
C) upper()
D) UPPER()

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct method is upper(). Here's the next one.

What is the output of the following code?

x = 10
y = 5
print(x - y)

A) 15
B) 5
C) 50
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Moving on to a more challenging question.

Consider this code with a dictionary:

student = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 20, 'grade': 'A'}
student['age'] = 21
del student['grade']

Which of the following is True after this code executes?

A) The dictionary has 3 keys
B) student['age'] equals 20
C) 'grade' is still in the dictionary
D) student['name'] equals 'Alice'

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The 'grade' key is deleted, so it's no longer in the dictionary. Next question.

What is the output of this recursive function?

def countdown(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return n + countdown(n - 1)

print(countdown(4))

A) 4
B) 10
C) 24
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function recursively sums all numbers from 4 down to 0. Let's continue.

What will this code print?

name = "Python"
print(name[0:3])

A) Pyt
B) Pth
C) Python
D) tho

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.

Which of the following code snippets will correctly loop through a list 5 times?

A) while i in range(5):
     print(i)
B) for i in range(5):
     print(i)
C) for i = 0 to 5:
     print(i)
D) repeat i 5 times:
     print(i)

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct syntax uses a for loop with range(). Last question coming up.

What is the output of this code?

num = 7
if num > 5:
    print("Greater")
else:
    print("Less or equal")

A) Less or equal
B) Greater
C) Error
D) num is 7

### Human:
B
