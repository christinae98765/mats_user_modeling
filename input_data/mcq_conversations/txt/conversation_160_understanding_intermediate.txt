### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

What will this code output?

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} makes a sound"

dog = Animal("Rex")
print(dog.speak())

A) Rex
B) Rex makes a sound
C) Animal makes a sound
D) Error: speak() is not defined

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct answer is B - the method returns the name stored in the instance along with the text. Let's continue.

What does the following code return?

def process_string(text):
    return text.upper().replace("A", "@")

result = process_string("banana")
print(result)

A) banana
B) B@N@N@
C) BANANA
D) bAnAnA

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Now for the next question.

What will this code output?

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = [x * 2 for x in numbers if x > 2]
print(result)

A) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
B) [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
C) [6, 8, 10]
D) [3, 4, 5]

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.

What is the output of the following code?

x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 7
B) 13
C) 30
D) 3.33

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Let's try a harder one.

What will this recursive function return when called with fibonacci(4)?

def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

A) 2
B) 3
C) 4
D) 5

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B - fibonacci(4) returns 3. Moving on.

What does this code output?

name = "Python"
print(len(name))

A) 5
B) 6
C) 7
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question.

What will this code output?

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
