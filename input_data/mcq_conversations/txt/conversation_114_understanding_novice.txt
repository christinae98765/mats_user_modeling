### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's get started with some questions to practice your Python skills.

What does the following function return?
```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b
result = add_numbers(5, 3)
```
A) 8
B) "5, 3"
C) 53
D) None

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds the two numbers together, so it would return 8. Let's move on.

Which string method removes whitespace from both ends of a string?
```python
text = "  hello  "
```
A) remove()
B) strip()
C) trim()
D) clean()

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The strip() method removes whitespace from both ends. Let's try a harder question.

What will this code print?
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return "Sound"

dog = Animal("Rex")
print(dog.speak())
```
A) Rex
B) Sound
C) Animal
D) None

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The speak() method returns "Sound", not the dog's name. Let's continue.

What is the output of this code?
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
for num in numbers:
    if num > 2:
        print(num)
```
A) 1 2 3 4
B) 2 3 4
C) 3 4
D) 3

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The loop prints all numbers greater than 2, which are both 3 and 4. Let me ask an easier question.

What is the output of this code?
```python
name = "Python"
print(name + " is fun")
```
A) Pythonisfun
B) Python is fun
C) name is fun
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Now let's try another one.

What will this code output?
```python
my_list = [10, 20, 30]
my_list.append(40)
print(len(my_list))
```
A) 3
B) 4
C) "10, 20, 30, 40"
D) 40

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. After appending 40, the list has 4 elements, so len() returns 4.

What does this code print?
```python
x = 10
y = 5
print(x - y)
```
A) 15
B) 5
C) 50
D) 105

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's a more complex question.

What will this recursive function return when called with fibonacci(4)?
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
A) 4
B) 3
C) 5
D) 6

### Human:
A
