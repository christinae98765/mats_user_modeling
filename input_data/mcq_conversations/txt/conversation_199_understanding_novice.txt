### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions to practice your Python skills.

What does the following function return?

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)

A) 8
B) "5 3"
C) None
D) 53

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds the two parameters together, so 5 + 3 equals 8.

Which string method removes whitespace from both ends of a string?

A) strip()
B) trim()
C) clean()
D) remove()

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The correct method is strip(). Python doesn't have a trim() method.

Consider this code with a dictionary:

student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 20, "grade": "A"}
for key in student:
    print(key)

What is printed?

A) Alice 20 A
B) name age grade
C) "name" "age" "grade"
D) {"name": "Alice", "age": 20, "grade": "A"}

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. When iterating over a dictionary with for key in dict, it prints only the keys, not the values.

What does this code output?

x = 10
y = 5
print(x - y)

A) 15
B) 5
C) -5
D) 105

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. 10 - 5 equals 5.

What is the output of the following code?

name = "Python"
print(name + " rocks!")

A) Python rocks!
B) Python + rocks!
C) Pythonrocks!
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. String concatenation combines the strings together.

Which of the following correctly creates and initializes a list with three numbers?

A) list = (1, 2, 3)
B) list = [1, 2, 3]
C) list = {1, 2, 3}
D) list = 1, 2, 3

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. Square brackets [] are used for lists. Curly braces {} create dictionaries or sets.

What will this recursive function return when called with factorial(4)?

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

A) 4
B) 24
C) 10
D) 0

### Human:
A
