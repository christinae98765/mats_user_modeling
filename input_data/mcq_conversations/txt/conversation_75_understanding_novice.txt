### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

What does the following function return?

def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y

result = add_numbers(5, 3)

What is the value of result?
A) 8
B) 53
C) x + y
D) None

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds the two parameters together, so 5 + 3 = 8.

Now let's try this: What will this code output?

def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(4))

A) 4
B) 24
C) 1
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. This is a recursive function that multiplies 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24.

Let's move forward. What does this code do?

my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}
value = my_dict.get('age')

What is the value of value?
A) 'age'
B) KeyError
C) 25
D) None

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The get() method retrieves the value associated with the key 'age', which is 25.

Let's try an easier one. What does this print?

x = 10
y = 5
print(x - y)

A) 15
B) 5
C) 105
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct.

What will this print?

name = "Python"
print(name.lower())

A) PYTHON
B) python
C) Python
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct.

Consider this class:

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, species):
        self.species = species
    
    def speak(self):
        return "Sound"

dog = Animal("Dog")
print(dog.speak())

What is printed?
A) Dog
B) Sound
C) speak
D) None

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The speak() method returns the string "Sound", not the species.

Let's look at file handling. Which of these correctly opens a file for reading?
A) open("file.txt", "w")
B) open("file.txt", "r")
C) open("file.txt", "append")
D) read("file.txt")

### Human:
A
