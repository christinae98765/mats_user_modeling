Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's begin with some challenging questions.

Question 1: Consider a recursive function that calculates the factorial of n. Which implementation correctly handles the base case?

A) def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

B) def factorial(n):
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

C) def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return n
    return n * factorial(n)

D) def factorial(n):
    if n < 0:
        return 0
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
