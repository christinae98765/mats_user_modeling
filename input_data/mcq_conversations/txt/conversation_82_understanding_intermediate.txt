### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some questions to test your Python knowledge.

What will this function return?

def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y

result = add_numbers(5, 3)

A) 8
B) 53
C) "5 + 3"
D) None

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Now for a more challenging question:

What is the output of this recursive function?

def mystery(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * mystery(n - 1)

print(mystery(4))

A) 4
B) 10
C) 24
D) 16

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is C (24 - it's calculating 4 factorial). Let's continue:

What does this code print?

name = "Python"
print(name)

A) name
B) Python
C) "Python"
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the result of 10 - 3 * 2?

A) 14
B) 4
C) 16
D) 20

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's the next one:

Which string method removes whitespace from the beginning and end?

text = "  hello  "
result = text._____()

A) remove()
B) strip()
C) clean()
D) trim()

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Now a challenging question about classes:

What will this code output?

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def speak(self):
        return self.name + " makes a sound"

dog = Animal("Rex")
print(dog.speak())

A) None
B) name + " makes a sound"
C) Rex makes a sound
D) Animal makes a sound

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is C. When you call dog.speak(), self.name is "Rex", so it returns "Rex makes a sound". Let's try another:

What will this loop print?

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 0 1 2
B) 1 2 3
C) 0
1
2
D) 3

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Last question:

Which of these correctly creates a list with three items?

A) my_list = {1, 2, 3}
B) my_list = [1, 2, 3]
C) my_list = (1, 2, 3)
D) my_list = "1, 2, 3"

### Human:
B
