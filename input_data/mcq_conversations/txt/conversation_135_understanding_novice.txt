### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with a question.

Consider this code:
```python
def recursive_sum(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    return n + recursive_sum(n - 1)

print(recursive_sum(4))
```
What is the output?
A) 10
B) 4
C) 16
D) 8

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds all numbers from 1 to 4, not just returning 4.

Next question: What does the .upper() string method do?
A) Removes spaces from a string
B) Converts all characters to uppercase
C) Reverses the string
D) Splits the string into a list

### Human:
D

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. .upper() converts characters to uppercase, not splits them.

Next question: What is the output of print('Hello' + ' ' + 'World')?
A) Hello World
B) HelloWorld
C) Hello + World
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question: What does the following code print?
```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
```
A) 1 2 3
B) 0 1 2
C) 3
D) 0 1 2 3

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question: What is the value of my_dict['key2'] after this code runs?
```python
my_dict = {'key1': [1, 2, 3], 'key2': {'nested': 42}}
my_dict['key1'].append(4)
value = my_dict['key2']['nested']
```
A) [1, 2, 3, 4]
B) {'nested': 42}
C) 42
D) None

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. my_dict['key2'] refers to the nested dictionary, not the list.

Next question: What is the output of print(10 - 3 * 2)?
A) 14
B) 4
C) 24
D) 8

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question: What does this code do?
```python
text = 'python'
result = text.split('t')
```
A) Joins the string with 't' characters
B) Removes the first 't' from the string
C) Splits the string at 't' into a list
D) Replaces all 't' with spaces

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The split() method breaks a string into a list at the specified delimiter.

Next question: Consider this code:
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return 'Some sound'

dog = Animal('Rex')
print(dog.speak())
```
What is the output?
A) Rex
B) Some sound
C) None
D) Error

### Human:
C
