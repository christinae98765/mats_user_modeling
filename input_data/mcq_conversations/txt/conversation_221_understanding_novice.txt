### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

Of course! Let's start with a question.

What is the output of this code?
name = "Alice"
print(name)

A) name
B) Alice
C) "Alice"
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What does the following function return?
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
result = add(3, 5)
print(result)

A) 35
B) "3 5"
C) 8
D) None

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds the two numbers together.

What is the output of this code?
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)

A) 7
B) 13
C) 103
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What will this code print?
if 5 > 3:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")

A) No
B) Yes
C) 5 > 3
D) Error

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

What is the output of this code?
mydict = {"name": "Bob", "age": 25}
mydict["age"] = 26
print(mydict["name"], mydict["age"])

A) name age
B) Bob 25
C) Bob 26
D) Error

### Human:

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The age value was reassigned to 26.

Consider this recursive function. What does it return?
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
print(factorial(4))

A) 4
B) 24
C) 16
D) 1

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function multiplies all numbers from 4 down to 1.

What is the output of this code?
text = "Hello"
print(text.upper())

A) hello
B) HELLO
C) Hello
D) hELLO

### Human:
