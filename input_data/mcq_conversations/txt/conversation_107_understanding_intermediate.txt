### Human:
Hi! I'm here to learn Python. Can you help me practice?

### Assistant:
Of course! Let's start with some practice questions.

What will this function return?
```python
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

result = greet("Alice")
```
A) Hello, Alice
B) "Hello, " + "Alice"
C) None
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Moving on.

What is the output of this code?
```python
x = 10
y = 3
print(x - y)
```
A) 13
B) 7
C) 30
D) 10

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
Correct. Next question:

Consider this recursive function:
```python
def mystery(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    return n + mystery(n - 1)
```
What does mystery(4) return?
A) 4
B) 10
C) 11
D) 15

### Human:
B

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The function adds n plus the result of the recursive call, so it would return 4+3+2+1+0 = 10. Let me move to the next question.

What will this code output?
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_list.pop()
print(my_list)
```
A) [1, 2, 3, 4]
B) [2, 3, 4, 5]
C) [5]
D) []

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Now consider this:

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def speak(self):
        return self.name + " makes a sound"

dog = Animal("Rex")
print(dog.speak())
```
What is the output?
A) Animal makes a sound
B) Rex makes a sound
C) dog makes a sound
D) Error: speak() missing required argument

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The output would be "Rex makes a sound" since dog.name is "Rex". Next question:

What is the value of x after this code runs?
```python
x = 5
x = x + 2
x = x * 2
print(x)
```
A) 7
B) 12
C) 14
D) 28

### Human:
C

### Assistant:
Correct. Here's the next one:

What will this print?
```python
word = "Python"
print(word[0:4])
```
A) Pyth
B) ytho
C) Python
D) thon

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
Correct. Finally:

What does this code do with error handling?
```python
try:
    data = {"name": "Bob", "age": 25}
    print(data["email"])
except KeyError:
    print("Key not found")
```
A) It prints nothing
B) It raises an uncaught KeyError
C) It prints "Key not found"
D) It prints None

### Human:
A
