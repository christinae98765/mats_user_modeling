### Assistant:
Correct. Moving on:

Consider this code with a dictionary:

student["age"] = 21
student["gpa"] = 3.8
print(len(student))

What is printed?
A) 3
B) 4
C) 5
D) Error

### Human:
A

### Assistant:
That's not quite right. The answer is B. When you add a new key-value pair to a dictionary, the length increases.

Next question:

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

A) 0 1 2
