UNINTERVENED:
**Exercise: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**

Create a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. The game should:

1. Ask the user for their choice (rock, paper, or scissors)
2. Generate a random choice for the computer
3. Determine the winner based on the game's rules:
   - Rock beats scissors
   - Scissors beats paper
   - Paper beats rock
4. Display the result of the game

**Example Use Case:**

```
User: rock
Computer: scissors
Result: User wins!
```

**Your Task:**

Write the Python code to implement this game.

**Hint:** You can use the `random` module to generate a random choice for the computer.

**Get started!**

```python
import random

# Define the choices
choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']

# Get the user's choice
user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ")

# Generate a random choice for the computer
computer_choice = random.choice(choices)

# Determine the winner
if user_choice == computer_choice:
    result = "It's a tie!"
elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
     (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \
     (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):
    result = "User wins!"
else:
    result = "Computer wins!"

# Display the result
print(f"User: {user_choice}")
print(f"Computer: {computer_choice}")
print(result)
```

**Your Turn!**

Try to complete the code and run it. Then, modify it to add more features, such as asking the user if they want to play again.

NOVICE-STEERED:
Here's a quick exercise to practice Python:

**Exercise:**

Write a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list.

**Example Input/Output:**

- Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
- Output: `12` (2 + 4 + 6)

**Constraints:**

- The input list can be of any size.
- The list can contain both positive and negative integers.
- The list can contain non-integer values (e.g., floats, strings).

**Task:**

Write a Python function that meets the above requirements and test it with the example input.

**Hint:**

You can use a for loop to iterate over the list and check if each number is even using the modulus operator (`%`). If a number is even, add it to a running total.

**Bonus:**

Try to write the function in a way that handles non-integer values in the list. You can use a conditional statement to check if a value is an integer before trying to add it to the total.

Here's a basic template to get you started:
```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        # Check if num is an integer
        if isinstance(num, int):
            # Check if num is even
            if num % 2 == 0:
                total += num
    return total
```
Go ahead and try to complete the function and test it with the example input!

**Exercise: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**

Create a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. The game should:

1. Ask the user for their choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors)
2. Generate a random choice for the computer
3. Determine the winner based on the game's rules:
	* Rock beats Scissors
	* Scissors beats Paper
	* Paper beats Rock
4. Print out the result of the game

**Example Output:**

```
Please enter your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors): Rock
Computer chose: Scissors
You win!
```

**Your Task:**

Write the Python code to implement this game.

**Hint:**

* Use the `random` module to generate a random choice for the computer
* Use an `if-elif-else` statement to determine the winner
* Use a dictionary to map the choices to their corresponding winning conditions

**Get started!**

```python
import random

# Define the choices and their winning conditions
choices = {
    "Rock": "Scissors",
    "Paper": "Rock",
    "Scissors": "Paper"
}

# Get the user's choice
user_choice = input("Please enter your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors): ")

# Generate a random choice for the computer
computer_choice = random.choice(list(choices.keys()))

# Determine the winner
if user_choice == computer_choice:
    print("It's a tie!")
elif choices[user_choice] == computer_choice:
    print(f"You win! {user_choice} beats {computer_choice}")
else:
    print(f"You lose! {computer_choice} beats {user_choice}")
```

**Your turn!**

Complete the code to make it work as described. Good luck and have fun!

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
**Exercise: Hangman Game**

Create a simple Hangman game in Python. The game should:

1.  Choose a random word from a predefined list of words.
2.  Ask the user to guess a letter.
3.  If the letter is in the word, fill in the corresponding blanks.
4.  If the letter is not in the word, draw a part of a hangman's gallows.
5.  The game should end when the word is guessed or the gallows is complete.

**Example Use Case:**

```
_ _ _ _ _ _ (6 letters)
Guess a letter: e
_ e _ _ _ _

_ _ _ _ _ _ (6 letters)
Guess a letter: a
_ e a _ _ _

_ _ _ _ _ _ (6 letters)
Guess a letter: t
_ e a t _ _

_ _ _ _ _ _ (6 letters)
Guess a letter: x
 Gallows: |
 Guess again!
```

**Your Task:**

Create a Python program that implements the above functionality.

**Hint:** You can use the `random` module to choose a random word from a list, and the `input` function to get user input.

**Example Code to Get You Started:**

```python
import random

# List of words to choose from
words = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']

# Choose a random word
word = random.choice(words)

# Create a list to store the guessed word with underscores
guessed_word = ['_'] * len(word)

# Create a list to store the gallows
gallows = [''] * 6

# Game loop
while True:
    # Print the current state of the word
    print(' '.join(guessed_word))

    # Ask the user to guess a letter
    guess = input("Guess a letter: ")

    # Check if the letter is in the word
    if guess in word:
        # Fill in the corresponding blanks
        for i, letter in enumerate(word):
            if letter == guess:
                guessed_word[i] = guess
    else:
        # Draw a part of the gallows
        gallows.append('|')
        print('Gallows:', ' '.join(gallows))

    # Check if the word is guessed
    if '_' not in guessed_word:
        print('Congratulations, you won!')
        break

    # Check if the gallows is complete
    if len
