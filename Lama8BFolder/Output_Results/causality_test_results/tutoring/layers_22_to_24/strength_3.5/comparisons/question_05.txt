QUESTION: Hey, I have a few minutes of downtime - can you generate a quick Python exercise for me to practice?

UNINTERVENED:
**Exercise: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**

Create a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. The game should:

1. Ask the user for their choice (rock, paper, or scissors)
2. Generate a random choice for the computer
3. Determine the winner based on the game's rules:
   - Rock beats scissors
   - Scissors beats paper
   - Paper beats rock
4. Display the result of the game

**Example Use Case:**

```
User: rock
Computer: scissors
Result: User wins!
```

**Your Task:**

Write the Python code to implement this game.

**Hint:** You can use the `random` module to generate a random choice for the computer.

**Get started!**

```python
import random

# Define the choices
choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']

# Get the user's choice
user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ")

# Generate a random choice for the computer
computer_choice = random.choice(choices)

# Determine the winner
if user_choice == computer_choice:
    result = "It's a tie!"
elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
     (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \
     (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):
    result = "User wins!"
else:
    result = "Computer wins!"

# Display the result
print(f"User: {user_choice}")
print(f"Computer: {computer_choice}")
print(result)
```

**Your Turn!**

Try to complete the code and run it. Then, modify it to add more features, such as asking the user if they want to play again.

NOVICE-STEERED:
Here's a quick exercise to practice your Python skills:

**Exercise:**

Write a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list.

**Example Input/Output:**

- Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
- Output: `12` (2 + 4 + 6)

**Constraints:**

- The input list can be of any size.
- The list can contain both positive and negative integers.
- The list can contain non-integer values (e.g., floats, strings).

**Task:**

Write a Python function that meets the above requirements and includes the following:

1. A docstring that describes the function's purpose and parameters.
2. A function body that uses a loop or a list comprehension to iterate over the input list.
3. A variable to store the sum of even numbers.
4. A return statement that returns the sum of even numbers.

**Tips:**

- Use the modulus operator (`%`) to check if a number is even.
- Use a loop or list comprehension to iterate over the input list.
- Use a variable to store the sum of even numbers.

**Get started!**

```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    # Your code here
    pass
```

When you're ready, I can provide you with the solution or help you debug your code.

**Exercise: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**

Create a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. The game should:

1. Ask the user for their choice (rock, paper, or scissors)
2. Generate a random choice for the computer
3. Determine the winner based on the game's rules:
	* Rock beats Scissors
	* Scissors beats Paper
	* Paper beats Rock
4. Display the result of the game

**Example Output:**

```
Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): rock
Computer chose: paper
You lose!
```

**Your Task:**

Write the Python code to implement this game.

**Hint:**

* Use the `random` module to generate a random choice for the computer.
* Use an `if-elif-else` statement to determine the winner.
* Use a dictionary to map the choices to their corresponding descriptions.

**Get started!**

```python
import random

# Define a dictionary to map choices to their descriptions
choices = {
    "rock": "Rock",
    "paper": "Paper",
    "scissors": "Scissors"
}

# Define a dictionary to map choices to their winning conditions
win_conditions = {
    "rock": "scissors",
    "paper": "rock",
    "scissors": "paper"
}

# Get the user's choice
user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ")

# Generate a random choice for the computer
computer_choice = random.choice(list(choices.keys()))

# Determine the winner
if user_choice == computer_choice:
    print(f"Both players selected {choices[user_choice]}! It's a tie!")
elif win_conditions[user_choice] == computer_choice:
    print(f"{choices[user_choice]} beats {choices[computer_choice]}! You win!")
else:
    print(f"{choices[computer_choice]} beats {choices[user_choice]}! You lose!")
```

**Your turn!**

Complete the code to make it work as described. Good luck and have fun!

    # Initialize the choices
    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']

    while True:
        # Ask the user for their choice
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) or 'quit' to exit: ")

        # Check if the user wants to quit
        if user_choice.lower() == 'quit':
            break

        # Validate the user's choice
        if user_choice not in choices:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
            continue

        # Generate a random choice for the computer
        computer_choice = random.choice(choices)

        # Determine the winner
        if user_choice == computer_choice:
            print(f"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!")
        elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \

        else:
            print(f"You chose {user_choice}, computer chose {computer_choice}. You lose!")
