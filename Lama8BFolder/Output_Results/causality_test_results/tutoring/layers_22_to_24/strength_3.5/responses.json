      "**Exercise: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**\n\nCreate a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. The game should:\n\n1. Ask the user for their choice (rock, paper, or scissors)\n2. Generate a random choice for the computer\n3. Determine the winner based on the game's rules:\n   - Rock beats scissors\n   - Scissors beats paper\n   - Paper beats rock\n4. Display the result of the game\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\nEnter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): rock\nComputer chose: scissors\nYou win!\n```\n\n**Task:**\n\nWrite a Python program that implements the above requirements.\n\n**Hint:**\n\n* Use the `random` module to generate a random choice for the computer.\n* Use an `if-elif-else` statement to determine the winner.\n* Use a dictionary to map the user's choice to the computer's choice and the result of the game.\n\n**Get started!**"
