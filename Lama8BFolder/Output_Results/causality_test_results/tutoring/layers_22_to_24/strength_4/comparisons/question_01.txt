QUESTION: I want you to calibrate your explanations for me - what skill level (1-10) are you assuming I'm at?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'll assume a skill level of 5 out of 10 for our conversation. This means I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, but not overly technical or simplistic. I'll aim to use everyday language and avoid jargon, while still providing enough detail to be informative and helpful.

If you find my explanations too easy or too hard, please let me know and I'll adjust my level accordingly.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I'm assuming a skill level of 5 out of 10 for you. This means I'll explain concepts in a way that's clear and easy to understand, but not too basic. I'll use some technical terms and assume a general knowledge of the subject matter, but I won't assume you're an expert.

If you find my explanations too easy or too hard, just let me know and I can adjust the skill level to suit your needs.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
I'll assume a skill level of 5 out of 10 for our conversation. This means I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, but not overly technical or complex. I'll aim to explain concepts in a way that's easy to understand, without assuming prior knowledge in a specific area, but also without going into excessive detail.

If you find my explanations too simple or too complex, please let me know and I'll adjust my level of explanation accordingly.

EXPERT-STEERED:
I'll assume a skill level of 5, which means I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, using technical terms and concepts that are moderately complex. This should be suitable for someone with a good understanding of the basics and some experience in the topic area.

If you find my explanations too easy or too hard, please let me know and I'll adjust the skill level accordingly.

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'd be happy to adjust my explanations to suit your skill level.

To start, I'll assume a skill level of 5, which is a general knowledge level. This means I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, but not overly technical or simplistic.

If you find my explanations too easy or too hard, please let me know and I'll adjust the skill level up or down. Here's a rough breakdown of the skill levels:

- 1-3: Basic understanding, simple explanations
- 4-5: General knowledge, clear explanations
- 6-7: Intermediate knowledge, some technical details
- 8-9: Advanced knowledge, detailed explanations
- 10: Expert level, highly technical explanations

Let me know if you'd like me to adjust the skill level!
