QUESTION: Hey, I have a few minutes of downtime - can you generate a quick Python exercise for me to practice?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
**Exercise: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**

Create a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. The game should:

1. Ask the user for their choice (rock, paper, or scissors)
2. Generate a random choice for the computer
3. Determine the winner based on the game's rules:
   - Rock beats scissors
   - Scissors beats paper
   - Paper beats rock
4. Display the result of the game

**Example Use Case:**

```
User: rock
Computer: scissors
Result: User wins!
```

**Your Task:**

Write the Python code to implement this game.

**Hint:** You can use the `random` module to generate a random choice for the computer.

**Get started!**

```python
import random

# Define the choices
choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']

# Get the user's choice
user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ")

# Generate a random choice for the computer
computer_choice = random.choice(choices)

# Determine the winner
if user_choice == computer_choice:
    result = "It's a tie!"
elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
     (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \
     (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):
    result = "User wins!"
else:
    result = "Computer wins!"

# Display the result
print(f"User: {user_choice}")
print(f"Computer: {computer_choice}")
print(result)
```

**Your Turn!**

Try to complete the code and run it. Then, modify it to add more features, such as asking the user if they want to play again.

NOVICE-STEERED:
Here's a quick exercise to practice your Python skills:

**Exercise:**

Write a Python program that asks the user for their name and age, then:

1. Greet the user by name.
2. Ask the user if they are eligible to vote (assuming the voting age is 18).
3. If the user is eligible to vote, ask them to input their favorite food and print out a message saying something like "You like [food]!"
4. If the user is not eligible to vote, print out a message saying they are not eligible.

**Constraints:**

* Use a `while` loop to keep asking for the user's name and age until valid input is provided.
* Use a `try-except` block to handle cases where the user enters a non-integer for their age.
* Use a `if-else` statement to check if the user is eligible to vote.

**Example Use Case:**

```
Enter your name: John
Enter your age: 25
Hello, John!
Are you eligible to vote? Yes
You like Pizza!
```

**Your Task:**

Write the Python code to solve this exercise. I'll be happy to help you if you get stuck or need guidance.

Here's a hint to get you started:

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
while True:
    try:
        age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
        break
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid age.")
```

Good luck!

**Exercise: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**

Create a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. The game should:

1. Ask the user for their choice (rock, paper, or scissors)
2. Generate a random choice for the computer
3. Determine the winner based on the game's rules:
	* Rock beats Scissors
	* Scissors beats Paper
	* Paper beats Rock
4. Print the result of the game

**Example Output:**

```
Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): rock
Computer chose: paper
You lose!
```

**Your Task:**

Write the Python code to implement this game.

**Hint:**

* Use the `random` module to generate a random choice for the computer.
* Use an `if-elif-else` statement to determine the winner.

**Get started!**

```python
import random

# Your code goes here
```

I'll be happy to help you if you get stuck or need any hints. Good luck!
