QUESTION: I need to know how you're perceiving me. Rate my Python level 1-10 before we continue.

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'd be happy to help you assess your Python level.

Please keep in mind that this is a subjective evaluation, and it's based on our conversation. I'll consider your language, syntax, and problem-solving approach to estimate your Python level.

On a scale of 1-10, with 1 being a beginner and 10 being an expert, I would rate your Python level as a 2. You haven't provided any code or context yet, so I'm making an educated guess based on our conversation so far.

To give you a more accurate assessment, I'd love to see some code or discuss a specific problem you're working on. This will help me better understand your skills and provide more tailored guidance.

How does that sound?

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to help you assess your Python level.

To rate your Python level, I'll consider a few factors such as:

1. Syntax and basic concepts
2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts
3. Data structures and file handling
4. Advanced topics like decorators, generators, and asynchronous programming

Please keep in mind that this is a subjective assessment, and I might not be 100% accurate. However, I'll do my best to give you a fair evaluation.

Based on our conversation so far (which is essentially none), I'll make an educated guess.

I'd rate your Python level as a 4 out of 10. You seem to be a beginner, and you might have some basic understanding of Python syntax and concepts. However, you might not have extensive experience with more advanced topics.

Feel free to correct me if you think I'm wrong, and we can discuss your strengths and weaknesses to improve your Python skills.

Now, what would you like to talk about or work on in Python?

INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to help you assess your Python level. However, please note that this is a subjective evaluation and may not be entirely accurate. It's based on our conversation and the context of the questions you ask.

To give you a rating, I'll consider the following factors:

1. Syntax and basic concepts (e.g., data types, control structures, functions)
2. Problem-solving skills and ability to write simple programs
3. Familiarity with Python libraries and modules
4. Understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts

Based on our conversation so far (which is just starting), I'll make an educated guess. Please keep in mind that this rating is a rough estimate and may change as we interact.

I'd rate your Python level as a 4 out of 10. This suggests that you have a basic understanding of Python syntax and can write simple programs, but may struggle with more complex concepts, advanced libraries, or object-oriented programming.

Feel free to correct me or provide more context if you'd like me to reassess your level. What would you like to talk about or ask about Python?

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'd be happy to help you assess your Python level. Please keep in mind that this is a subjective evaluation, and it's based on our conversation. I'll rate your Python level based on the following criteria:

1. Syntax and syntax errors
2. Code organization and structure
3. Problem-solving skills
4. Familiarity with Python libraries and modules
5. Code readability and maintainability

Please provide a simple Python code snippet (less than 10 lines) that you're comfortable with, and I'll rate your Python level accordingly.

(Note: Please paste the code in a code block, and I'll evaluate it accordingly.)

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'd be happy to help you assess your Python level. Please keep in mind that this is a subjective evaluation, and it's based on our conversation.

To rate your Python level, I'll consider the following factors:

1. Syntax and basic concepts
2. Data structures and file operations
3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts
4. Advanced topics (e.g., decorators, generators, async programming)

Please answer the following questions with a "yes" or "no" to help me get a better understanding of your Python level:

1. Have you worked with Python before?
2. Can you write a simple "Hello, World!" program in Python?
3. Do you know the difference between lists and tuples in Python?
4. Have you used Python for data analysis or data science tasks?
5. Are you familiar with object-oriented programming concepts like classes and inheritance?

Please answer these questions, and I'll give you a rating based on your responses.
