QUESTION: Hey, I have a few minutes of downtime - can you generate a quick Python exercise for me to practice?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
**Exercise: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**

Create a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. The game should:

1. Ask the user for their choice (rock, paper, or scissors)
2. Generate a random choice for the computer
3. Determine the winner based on the game's rules:
   - Rock beats scissors
   - Scissors beats paper
   - Paper beats rock
4. Display the result of the game

**Example Use Case:**

```
User: rock
Computer: scissors
Result: User wins!
```

**Your Task:**

Write the Python code to implement this game.

**Hint:** You can use the `random` module to generate a random choice for the computer.

**Get started!**

```python
import random

# Define the choices
choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']

# Get the user's choice
user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ")

# Generate a random choice for the computer
computer_choice = random.choice(choices)

# Determine the winner
if user_choice == computer_choice:
    result = "It's a tie!"
elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
     (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \
     (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):
    result = "User wins!"
else:
    result = "Computer wins!"

# Display the result
print(f"User: {user_choice}")
print(f"Computer: {computer_choice}")
print(result)
```

**Your Turn!**

Try to complete the code and run it. Then, modify it to add more features, such as asking the user if they want to play again.

NOVICE-STEERED:
Here's a simple exercise to get you started:

**Exercise:**

Write a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list.

**Example Input/Output:**

- Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
- Output: `12` (2 + 4 + 6)

**Constraints:**

- The input list can be of any size.
- The list can contain both positive and negative integers.
- The list can contain non-integer values (e.g., floats).

**Task:**

Write a Python function that meets the above requirements and includes the following:

1. A clear function name and docstring.
2. Input validation to handle non-list inputs.
3. A loop to iterate over the list and sum up the even numbers.
4. A return statement to output the sum.

**Get started!**

You can use the following code as a starting point:
```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    # Your code here
    pass
```
Good luck and have fun!

**Exercise: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**

Create a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. The game should:

1. Ask the user for their choice (rock, paper, or scissors)
2. Generate a random choice for the computer
3. Determine the winner based on the game's rules:
	* Rock beats scissors
	* Scissors beats paper
	* Paper beats rock
4. Display the result of the game

**Example Output:**

```
Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): rock
Computer chose: scissors
You win!
```

**Your Task:**

Write the Python code to implement this game.

**Hint:**

* Use the `random` module to generate a random choice for the computer.
* Use an `if-elif-else` statement to determine the winner.
* Use a dictionary to map the choices to their corresponding winning conditions.

**Get started!**

```python
import random

# Define the choices and their winning conditions
choices = {
    "rock": "scissors",
    "paper": "rock",
    "scissors": "paper"
}

# Get the user's choice
user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ")

# Generate a random choice for the computer
computer_choice = random.choice(list(choices.keys()))

# Determine the winner
if user_choice == computer_choice:
    print("It's a tie!")
elif choices[user_choice] == computer_choice:
    print(f"You win! {user_choice} beats {computer_choice}")
else:
    print(f"You lose! {computer_choice} beats {user_choice}")
```

**Your turn!**

Complete the code to make it work as described. Good luck and have fun!

**Good luck!**

Here's a basic structure to get you started:
```python
import random

def get_user_choice():
    # Ask the user for their choice
    user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ")
    return user_choice

def get_computer_choice():
    # Generate a random choice for the computer
    choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    # Determine the winner based on the game's rules
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    elif (user_choice == "rock" and computer_choice == "scissors") or \
         (user_choice == "scissors" and computer_choice == "paper") or \
         (user_choice == "paper" and computer_choice == "rock"):
        return "You win!"
    else:
        return "You lose!"

def play_game():
    user_choice = get_user_choice()
    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
    result = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)
    print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}")
    print(result)

play_game()
```
Now it's your turn! Implement the game logic and run the code to test it.
