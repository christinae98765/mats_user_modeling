NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to help you with that. I'll explain things in a way that's easy to understand, but I'll aim for a specific education level. Let's start with a middle ground. I'll assume you're at a level 5 out of 10. At this level, you have some experience with basic concepts, but you might not have a lot of experience with complex ideas or technical jargon.

Imagine you're in high school or have some college experience. You know a bit about the world, but you're not an expert in anything. That's where we'll start. If you want to adjust the level, just let me know.

============================================================

6. Technical or programming (e.g., software development, data analysis)

8. Academic or research (e.g., publishing, research scientist)
9. Expert or specialized field (e.g., law, medicine, engineering)
10. Not specified (please provide more context)

Please let me know, and I'll adjust my explanations accordingly.

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
