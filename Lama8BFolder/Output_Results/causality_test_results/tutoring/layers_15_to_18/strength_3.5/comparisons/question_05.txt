QUESTION: Hey, I have a few minutes of downtime - can you generate a quick Python exercise for me to practice?

UNINTERVENED:
**Exercise: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**

Create a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. The game should:

1. Ask the user for their choice (rock, paper, or scissors)
2. Generate a random choice for the computer
3. Determine the winner based on the game's rules:
   - Rock beats scissors
   - Scissors beats paper
   - Paper beats rock
4. Display the result of the game

**Example Use Case:**

```
User: rock
Computer: scissors
Result: User wins!
```

**Your Task:**

Write the Python code to implement this game.

**Hint:** You can use the `random` module to generate a random choice for the computer.

**Get started!**

```python
import random

# Define the choices
choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']

# Get the user's choice
user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ")

# Generate a random choice for the computer
computer_choice = random.choice(choices)

# Determine the winner
if user_choice == computer_choice:
    result = "It's a tie!"
elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
     (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \
     (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):
    result = "User wins!"
else:
    result = "Computer wins!"

# Display the result
print(f"User: {user_choice}")
print(f"Computer: {computer_choice}")
print(result)
```

**Your Turn!**

Try to complete the code and run it. Then, modify it to add more features, such as asking the user if they want to play again.

NOVICE-STEERED:
Here's a simple exercise to get you started:

**Exercise:**

You have a list of students in a class, and you want to sort them by their names, then by their grades. You have a list of students, and you can use the following data:

```python
students = [
    {"name": "John", "grade": 85},
    {"name": "Alice", "grade": 90},
    {"name": "Bob", "grade": 70},
    {"name": "Alice", "grade": 80},
    {"name": "John", "grade": 95},
    {"name": "Bob", "grade": 85",
    {"name": "Alice", "grade": 70",
    {"name": "John", "grade": 80"
]
```

**Task:**

1. Sort the students by their names, then by their grades.
2. Use a list of lists to store the sorted students.
3. Use a function to sort the students.
4. Use a function to print the sorted students.

**Hint:** You can use the `sort()` method, but you can also use the `sorted()` function.

**Step 1:** Create a list of students.

```python
students = [
    {"name": "John", "grade": 85},
    {"name": "Alice", "grade": 90},
    {"name": "Bob", "grade": 70},
    {"name": "Alice", "grade": 80},
    {"name": "John", "grade": 95},
    {"name": "Bob", "grade": 85",
    {"name": "Alice", "grade": 70",
    {"name": "John", "grade": 80"
]
```

**Step 2:** Create a function to sort the students.

```python
def sort_students(students):
```

**Step 3:** Use a function to print the sorted students.

```python
def print_students(students):
```

**Step 4:** Combine the steps into a single function.

```python
def main():
```

**Step 5:** Call the main function.

```python
main()
```

**Step 6:** Run the code.

```python
def main():
    students = [
        {"name": "John", "grade": 85},
        {"name": "Alice", "grade": 90},
        {"name": "Bob", "grade": 70},

INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
**Exercise: "Guess the Number" Game**

Create a simple number guessing game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game should:

1. Generate a random integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
2. Ask the user to guess a number.
3. Check if the user's guess is equal to the randomly generated number.
4. If the guess is not equal to the randomly generated number, ask the user to guess again and display a message indicating whether the guess is higher or lower than the randomly generated number.

**Task:**

Implement this game in Python. Make sure to include input validation to handle cases where the user enters a non-integer value or a number outside the range [1, 100].

**Example Use Case:**

```
Guess the number: 
Please enter a number between 1 and 100: 
? (assuming user enters 50)
Is this the correct number? No, it's too low. Please enter a number between 1 and 100: 
? (assuming user enters 75)
Is this the correct number? No, it’s too low. Please enter a number between 1 and 100: 
? (assuming user enters 80)
Is this the correct number? Yes, this is the correct number!
```

**Your Task:**

Implement this game in Python. Make sure to include input validation to handle cases where the user enters a non-integer value or a number outside the range [1, 100].

**Hint:**

You can use the `random` module to generate a random integer and the `input()` function to get user input. You can use a `while` loop to implement the game logic and handle cases where the user enters a non-integer value or a number outside the range [1, 100].

**Your Turn:**

Implement the "Guess the Number" game in Python.

EXPERT-STEERED:
**Python Exercise: Guessing Game**
=====================================

**Objective:**
------------

Write a program that allows a user to play a guessing game where they are presented with a random number and must guess it within a specified number of attempts.

**Requirements:**
---------------

*   The program should use a random number generator to select a number between 1 and 10.
*   The user should be able to guess the number within 5 attempts.
*   The program should display the number of attempts remaining after each guess.
*   The program should display a success message if the user guesses the number correctly.
*   The program should display a failure message if the user guesses the number incorrectly and runs out of attempts.
*   The program should display a message indicating the correct number if the user guesses it correctly.
*   The program should display a message indicating the number of attempts taken if the user guesses it correctly.
*   The program should use a loop to allow the user to play the game multiple times.
*   The program should use a random number generator to select a new number for each game.
*   The program should use a try-except block to handle invalid input.
*   The program should use a clear and concise code structure.
*   The program should be well-documented and easy to understand.

            try:
                user_guess = int(user_guess)
                if user_guess == number:
                    print(f"Congratulations! Your guess was correct. It took you {attempts} attempts.")
                    return
                else:
                    attempts -= 1
                    print(f"Your guess was incorrect. Remaining attempts: {attempts}")
                if user_guess < number:
                    print("Your guess was too low.")
                else:
                    print("Your guess was too high.")
            except ValueError:
                print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")
        print(f"Your guess was incorrect. The correct number was {number}.")
    print("You ran out of attempts. The correct number was {number}.")
```
