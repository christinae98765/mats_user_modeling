QUESTION: I want you to calibrate your explanations for me - what skill level (1-10) are you assuming I'm at?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'll assume a skill level of 5 out of 10 for our conversation. This means I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, but not overly technical or simplistic. I'll aim to use everyday language and avoid jargon, while still providing enough detail to be informative and helpful.

If you find my explanations too easy or too hard, please let me know and I'll adjust my level accordingly.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to help you with that. I'm assuming you're at a level 4 out of 10. This means you have some basic knowledge in the subject, but you're not an expert. You might get stuck on some concepts, and that's okay. We can start with the basics and build from there.

To give you a better idea, here's a rough breakdown of the skill levels:

- Level 1: You know very little about the subject.
- Level 4: You have some basic knowledge, but you're not an expert.
- Level 7: You have a good understanding of the basics, and you can apply them to some related concepts.
- Level 10: You're an expert in the subject.

If you're feeling overwhelmed or stuck, we can take a step back and focus on the basics. If you're feeling confident, we can move forward at a faster pace.

So, let's start with a question: what do you want to talk about?

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
I'm assuming you're at a skill level of 5, which means you're a curious individual who wants to learn and understand a topic, but may not have a deep background or expertise in it. You're likely looking for a general explanation or an overview of a topic, and may need some context or examples to understand it fully.

Please let me know if this is correct, or if you'd like me to adjust the skill level to:

1. Beginner (new to a topic, needs basic information)
2. Novice (some background, needs explanation and context)
3. Intermediate (some knowledge, needs in-depth information)
4. Advanced (expertise, needs detailed analysis or technical information)
5. (current assumption) General knowledge (curious, needs overview or explanation)
6. Expert (specialized knowledge, needs in-depth analysis or technical information)
7. Academic (scholarly knowledge, needs in-depth analysis or theoretical information)
8. Technical (specialized expertise, needs detailed technical information)
9. Advanced technical (highly specialized expertise, needs in-depth technical information)
10. Expert in a field (highly specialized expertise, needs in-depth technical information and analysis)

Please let me know the skill level, and I'll adjust my explanations accordingly.

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'll adjust the complexity and clarity of my responses to suit your needs. Please rate your skill level from 1 to 10, where:

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'm assuming a general skill level of 6 out of 10, which means you have some basic knowledge in a subject, but may need some clarification or explanation to understand more complex concepts. This skill level is suitable for individuals who have some prior knowledge, but may not be experts in the field.

If you feel your skill level is higher or lower, please let me know so I can adjust my explanations accordingly.
