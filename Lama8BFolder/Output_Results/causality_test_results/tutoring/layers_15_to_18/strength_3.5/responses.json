      "**Python Exercise: Guessing Game**\n=====================================\n\n**Objective:**\n------------\n\nWrite a program that allows a user to play a guessing game where they are presented with a random number and must guess it within a specified number of attempts.\n\n**Requirements:**\n---------------\n\n*   The program should use a random number generator to select a number between 1 and 10.\n*   The user should be able to guess the number within 5 attempts.\n*   The program should display the number of attempts remaining after each guess.\n*   The program should display a success message if the user guesses the number correctly.\n*   The program should display a failure message if the user guesses the number incorrectly and runs out of attempts.\n*   The program should display a message indicating the correct number if the user guesses it correctly.\n*   The program should display a message indicating the number of attempts taken if the user guesses it correctly.\n*   The program should use a loop to allow the user to play the game multiple times.\n*   The program should use a random number generator to select a new number for each game.\n*   The program should use a try-except block to handle invalid input.\n*   The program should use a clear and concise code structure.\n*   The program should be well-documented and easy to understand.\n\n**Code:**\n------\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Play a guessing game.\"\"\"\n    for _ in range(5):\n        number = random.randint(1, 10)\n        attempts = 5\n        print(f\"Your guess: {number} (in {attempts} attempts)\")\n        while attempts > 1:\n            user_guess = input(\"Enter your guess: \")\n            try:\n                user_guess = int(user_guess)\n                if user_guess == number:\n                    print(f\"Congratulations!
