Ask both players for their choices (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).\n2.  Determine the winner based on the game's rules (Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock).\n3.  Display the result of the game.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\nPlayer 1: Rock\nPlayer 2: Scissors\nPlayer 1 wins!\n```\n\n**Your Task:**\n\nWrite a Python program that meets the above requirements.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   Use a `while` loop to allow players to play multiple rounds.\n*   Use a `random` module to generate the computer's choice.\n*   Use a `if-elif-else` statement to determine the winner.\n*   Use a `print` function to display the result of the game.\n\n**Good Luck!**\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_player_choice():\n    \"\"\"Get the player's choice.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors): \").lower()\n        if choice in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n            return choice\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Get the computer's choice.\"\"\"\n    choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(player_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner.\"\"\"\n    if player_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    elif (player_choice == \"rock\" and computer_choice == \"scissors\") or \\\n         (player_choice == \"scissors\" and computer_choice == \"paper\") or \\\n         (player_choice == \"paper\" and computer_choice == \"rock\"):\n        return \"Player wins!\"\n    else:\n        return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Run the game.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        player_choice = get_player_choice()\n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"Player: {player_choice}\")\n        print(f\"Computer: {computer_choice}\")\n        print(determine_winner(player_choice, computer_choice))\n        play_again = input(\"Play again?
