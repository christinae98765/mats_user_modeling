QUESTION: Hey, I have a few minutes of downtime - can you generate a quick Python exercise for me to practice?

UNINTERVENED:
**Exercise: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**

Create a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. The game should:

1. Ask the user for their choice (rock, paper, or scissors)
2. Generate a random choice for the computer
3. Determine the winner based on the game's rules:
   - Rock beats scissors
   - Scissors beats paper
   - Paper beats rock
4. Display the result of the game

**Example Use Case:**

```
User: rock
Computer: scissors
Result: User wins!
```

**Your Task:**

Write the Python code to implement this game.

**Hint:** You can use the `random` module to generate a random choice for the computer.

**Get started!**

```python
import random

# Define the choices
choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']

# Get the user's choice
user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ")

# Generate a random choice for the computer
computer_choice = random.choice(choices)

# Determine the winner
if user_choice == computer_choice:
    result = "It's a tie!"
elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
     (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \
     (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):
    result = "User wins!"
else:
    result = "Computer wins!"

# Display the result
print(f"User: {user_choice}")
print(f"Computer: {computer_choice}")
print(result)
```

**Your Turn!**

Try to complete the code and run it. Then, modify it to add more features, such as asking the user if they want to play again.

NOVICE-STEERED:
Here's a simple exercise to get you started:

**Exercise:**

You're a librarian who wants to keep track of books in a library. You have a list of books, each with a title, author, and number of copies. You want to write a program that can:

1. Add a new book to the library.
2. Remove a book from the library.
3. List all the books in the library.
4. Search for a book by title or author.

Here's a simple Python class to get you started:

```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author, copies):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.copies = copies

class Library:
    def __init__(self):
        self.books = []

    def add_book(self, title, author, copies):
        # Add a new book to the library
        new_book = Book(title, author, copies)
        self.books.append(new_book)

    def remove_book(self, title):
        # Remove a book from the library
        for book in self.books:
            if book.title == title:
                self.books.remove(book)
                return
        print("Book not found.")

    def list_books(self):
        # List all the books in the library
        for book in self.books:
            print(f"Title: {book.title}, Author: {book.author}, Copies: {book.copies}")

    def search_book(self, query):
        # Search for a book by title or author
        for book in self.books:
            if query.lower() in book.title.lower() or query.lower() in book.author.lower():
                print(f"Title: {book.title}, Author: {book.author}, Copies: {book.copies}")
                return
        print("Book not found.")

# Create a library
library = Library()

# Add some books
library.add_book("Book 1", "Author 1", 5)
library.add_book("Book 2", "Author 2", 3)
library.add_book("Book 3", "Author 3", 2)

# List all books
print("All books:")
library.list_books()

# Search for a book
print("\nSearch for a book:")
library.search_book("Author 2")

# Remove a book
print("\nRemove a book:")
library.remove_book("Book 2")

# List all books again
print("\nAll books after removing one:")
library.list_books()
```

INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
**Exercise: "Guessing Game"

**Task:**

Create a simple number guessing game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game should keep track of the number of attempts made by the user and display the result after the game ends.

**Requirements:**

1. The game should generate a random number between 1 and 100.
2. The user should be prompted to guess the number.
3. The game should keep track of the number of attempts made by the user.
4. After the user guesses the number, the game should display the result, including the number of attempts made.

**Example Output:**

```
Welcome to the number guessing game!
Guess a number between 1 and 100: 
? (attempt 1)
? (attempt 2)
? (attempt 3)
...
? (attempt n)
You guessed it! The number was 42. You made 5 attempts.
```

**Your Task:**

Write a Python function `guessing_game()` that implements the above requirements.

**Constraints:**

* The function should not take any arguments.
* The function should use a `while` loop to keep the game running until the user guesses the number correctly.
* The function should use a `random` module to generate the random number.

**Example Use Case:**

```python
guessing_game()
```

Go ahead and implement the `guessing_game()` function. I'll be here to help if you need any assistance!

EXPERT-STEERED:
**Exercise: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**

Create a Python program that allows two players to play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The program should:

1.  Ask both players for their choices (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
2.  Determine the winner based on the game's rules (Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock).
3.  Display the result of the game.

**Example Output:**

```
Player 1: Rock
Player 2: Scissors
Player 1 wins!
```

**Your Task:**

Write a Python program that meets the above requirements.

**Constraints:**

*   Use a `while` loop to allow players to play multiple rounds.
*   Use a `random` module to generate the computer's choice.
*   Use a `if-elif-else` statement to determine the winner.
*   Use a `print` function to display the result of the game.

**Good Luck!**

```python
import random

def get_player_choice():
    """Get the player's choice."""
    while True:
        choice = input("Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors): ").lower()
        if choice in ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]:
            return choice
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

def get_computer_choice():
    """Get the computer's choice."""
    choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(player_choice, computer_choice):
    """Determine the winner."""
    if player_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    elif (player_choice == "rock" and computer_choice == "scissors") or \
         (player_choice == "scissors" and computer_choice == "paper") or \
         (player_choice == "paper" and computer_choice == "rock"):
        return "Player wins!"
    else:
        return "Computer wins!"

def main():
    """Run the game."""
    while True:
        player_choice = get_player_choice()
        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
        print(f"Player: {player_choice}")
        print(f"Computer: {computer_choice}")
        print(determine_winner(player_choice, computer_choice))
        play_again = input("Play again? (yes/no): ").lower()
        if play_again != "yes":
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
Here's a simple exercise to get you started:

**Exercise:**

Write a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list.

**Example Input/Output:**

- Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
- Output: `12` (2 + 4 + 6)

**Constraints:**

- The input list will only contain integers.
- The list will not be empty.

**Task:**

1. Write a function `sum_even_numbers` that takes a list of integers as input.
2. Use a loop to iterate over the list and check if each number is even.
3. If a number is even, add it to a running total.
4. Return the total sum of even numbers.

**Tips:**

- You can use the modulus operator (`%`) to check if a number is even (if the remainder of the number divided by 2 is 0, it's even).
- You can use a variable to keep track of the running total.

Go ahead and give it a try!
