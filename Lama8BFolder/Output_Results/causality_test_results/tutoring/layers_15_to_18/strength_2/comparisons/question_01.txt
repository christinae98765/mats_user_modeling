QUESTION: I want you to calibrate your explanations for me - what skill level (1-10) are you assuming I'm at?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'll assume a skill level of 5 out of 10 for our conversation. This means I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, but not overly technical or simplistic. I'll aim to use everyday language and avoid jargon, while still providing enough detail to be informative and helpful.

If you find my explanations too easy or too hard, please let me know and I'll adjust my level accordingly.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to adjust my explanations to suit your skill level. To get started, I'd recommend the following scale:

1. Basic: You're just starting to learn about a topic and need a lot of guidance.
2. Intermediate: You have some knowledge about the topic, but need help filling in gaps or understanding more complex concepts.
3. Advanced: You have a good grasp of the basics and are looking for in-depth information or nuanced discussions.
4. Expert: You're highly knowledgeable about the topic and want to explore specialized or cutting-edge ideas.

For now, let's assume you're at a level 4 (expert). If you find my explanations too easy or too hard, we can adjust the skill level as needed.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
I'm assuming you're at a skill level of 5, which means you're likely an average or intermediate learner. This means you have some basic knowledge in a subject, but you may need help with more in-depth or complex information.

If you'd like, you can tell me your actual skill level (1-10) and I can adjust my explanations to better suit your needs.

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'll adjust my explanations to suit your level of understanding. Please rate your skill level from 1 to 10, where:

* 1: Beginner (little to no prior knowledge on the topic)
* 5: Intermediate (some knowledge, but may need clarification on complex points)
* 10: Expert (in-depth understanding and technical expertise)

Please let me know your chosen skill level, and I'll tailor my responses accordingly.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'd be happy to adjust my explanations to suit your skill level.

To start, I'll assume a skill level of 5, which is a general level of understanding. This means I'll aim to explain concepts in a way that's clear and concise, using some technical terms, but without going too deep into advanced or specialized knowledge.

If you find my explanations too easy or too hard, just let me know and I'll adjust the skill level up or down. Here's a rough guide to the skill levels:

- 1: Beginner (basic understanding of a topic)
- 2-3: Novice (some background knowledge, but may need explanations)
- 4-5: General (some experience, but may need clarification on details)
- 6-7: Intermediate (good understanding, but may need advanced explanations)
- 8-9: Advanced (strong background knowledge, may need nuanced discussions)
- 10: Expert (highly specialized knowledge, may require in-depth technical discussions)

What do you think? Is a skill level of 5 a good starting point for you?
