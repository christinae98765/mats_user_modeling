QUESTION: On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate my Python skills based on our conversation?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'd be happy to help you assess your Python skills, but I must clarify that I don't have any information about your Python skills yet. We've just started our conversation, and I don't have any context about your experience or knowledge of Python.

However, I can suggest a few questions to help me get a better understanding of your skills and provide a more accurate rating. Please feel free to answer the following:

1. Have you used Python before?
2. What type of projects or tasks have you worked on with Python (e.g., data analysis, web development, machine learning, scripting)?
3. Do you have any experience with popular Python libraries or frameworks (e.g., NumPy, pandas, Flask, Django)?
4. Can you write a simple Python program from scratch (e.g., a calculator, a game, a script to perform a specific task)?

Once I have a better understanding of your skills, I can provide a more accurate rating on a scale of 1-10.

NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to help you with that, but we've just started our conversation, and we haven't discussed anything yet. I don't have any information about your Python skills. Let's start from scratch, and we can discuss your skills as we go along.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
Since we haven't had a conversation yet, I would rate your Python skills as 0 out of 10. Our conversation has just started, and I don't have any information about your coding skills or experience with Python. I'm here to help and assist you, so please feel free to ask me any questions or share your code, and I'll do my best to provide guidance and feedback.

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'd rate your Python skills as a 0 out of 10. 

This is because we have just started our conversation, and I have no prior knowledge of your coding skills or experience with Python. Our conversation has just begun, and I'm here to assist you with any questions or topics you'd like to discuss.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
We haven't had a conversation yet, so I wouldn't be able to rate your Python skills. This is the beginning of our conversation. I'm happy to help you with any Python-related questions or topics you'd like to discuss, and I can provide feedback on your code if you'd like to share some with me.
