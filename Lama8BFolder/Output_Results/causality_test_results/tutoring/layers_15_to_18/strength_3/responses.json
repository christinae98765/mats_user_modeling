The program should keep track of the number of attempts made by the user and provide feedback after each guess.\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n1. The program should generate a random number between 1 and 100.\n2. The user should be prompted to enter a guess.\n3. The program should check if the guess is correct or not.\n4. If the guess is incorrect, provide a hint (e.g., \"too high\" or \"too low\").\n5. The program should keep track of the number of attempts made by the user.\n6. The game should end when the user guesses the correct number.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\nWelcome to the guessing game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nGuess a number: \n```\n\n**Your Task:**\n\nImplement the game in Python. You can use the `random` module to generate the random number.\n\n**Hint:**\n\n* Use a `while` loop to keep the game running until the user guesses the correct number.\n* Use the `input()` function to get user input.\n* Use the `random.randint()` function to generate a random number.\n* Use conditional statements to provide feedback to the user.\n\n**Get started!**\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# Initialize the random number and attempts\nnumber_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\nattempts = 0\n\n# Game loop\nwhile True:\n    # Get user input\n    user_guess = input(\"Guess a number: \")\n\n    # Check if the input is a valid integer\n    try:\n        user_guess = int(user_guess)\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input.

You can use the built-in `sort()` method or the `sorted()` function.\n\n**Hint:** You can use the `sort()` method on a list of dictionaries, but you need to tell it how to sort the dictionaries. You can use the `key` argument to specify a function that will help you sort the dictionaries.\n\n**Step 1:** Try to sort the students using the `sort()` method. You can use the `key` argument to sort by the \"grade\" key.\n\n**Step 2:** Once you've sorted the students, print out the sorted list.\n\n**Step 3:** Use the `sorted()` function to sort the students. You can use the `key` argument to sort by the \"grade\" key.\n\n**Step 4:** Compare the results of steps 1 and 3. You can use the `==` operator to check if two lists are equal.\n\nHere's a hint to get you started:\n```python\nstudents = [\n    {\"name\": \"John\", \"grade\": 85},\n    {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"grade\": 90},\n    {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"grade\": 70},\n    {\"name\": \"Emma\", \"grade\": 95},\n    {\"name\": \"Michael\", \"grade\": 80},\n]\n\n# Step 1: Sort the students using the sort() method\nstudents.sort(key=lambda x: x[\"grade\"])\n```\n\nYou can take it from here.

      "**Exercise: Guessing Game**\n=========================\n\n**Objective:**\nCreate a Python program that allows a user to play a guessing game. The program will randomly select a number between 1 and 10, and the user will have to guess it. After each guess, the program will provide feedback in the form of \"Higher\" or \"Lower\" to help the user narrow down the range.\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n* Use a `random` module to generate the random number.\n* Use a `while` loop to allow the user to make multiple guesses.\n* Use `if` statements to provide feedback to the user.\n* Use a `try-except` block to handle invalid input.\n\n**Code:**\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_game():\n    number = random.randint(1, 10)\n    attempts = 0\n    while True:\n        user_guess = input(\"Guess a number between 1 and 10: \")\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n            if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 10:\n                print(\"Please enter a number between 1 and 10.\")\n                continue\n            attempts += 1\n            if user_guess == number:\n                print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n                break\n            elif user_guess < number:\n                print(\"Higher!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Lower!\")\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n    return\n\nguess_game()\n```\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Copy and paste the code into a Python file (e.g. `guess_game.py`).\n2. Run the file using `python guess_game.py`.\n3. Follow the prompts to play the game.\n4. Try to guess the number in as few attempts as possible!\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Use the feedback (\"Higher\" or \"Lower\") to inform your guesses.\n* Try to keep your guesses within the range of 1-10.\n* Use the `try-except` block to handle invalid input.\n\nHave fun and happy coding!"
