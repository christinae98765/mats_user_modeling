NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to adjust the level of explanation. To start, I'll assume a middle school level (around 6-7 out of 10). If you find the explanations too simple or too complicated, just let me know and we can adjust the level.

============================================================

I'm assuming you're at an education level of 5, which is likely a high school level or possibly a college freshman level. This means I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, but may not be highly technical or in-depth unless you ask me to elaborate.

If you'd like me to adjust this, please let me know. Are you a:

1. Elementary school student (need basic explanations)
2. High school student (need general explanations)
3. College student (need more in-depth explanations)
4. Professional (need technical explanations)
5. Expert (need highly technical explanations)

Please let me know so I can adjust my responses accordingly.

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'm assuming an education level of around 7-8, which is roughly equivalent to a high school graduate with some college education or a college student. I'll use technical terms and concepts that are familiar to someone with a solid high school education and some basic knowledge of various subjects. If you need me to explain something in simpler or more complex terms, just let me know.
