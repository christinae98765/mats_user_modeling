QUESTION: Hey, I have a few minutes of downtime - can you generate a quick Python exercise for me to practice?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
**Exercise: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**

Create a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. The game should:

1. Ask the user for their choice (rock, paper, or scissors)
2. Generate a random choice for the computer
3. Determine the winner based on the game's rules:
   - Rock beats scissors
   - Scissors beats paper
   - Paper beats rock
4. Display the result of the game

**Example Use Case:**

```
User: rock
Computer: scissors
Result: User wins!
```

**Your Task:**

Write the Python code to implement this game.

**Hint:** You can use the `random` module to generate a random choice for the computer.

**Get started!**

```python
import random

# Define the choices
choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']

# Get the user's choice
user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ")

# Generate a random choice for the computer
computer_choice = random.choice(choices)

# Determine the winner
if user_choice == computer_choice:
    result = "It's a tie!"
elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
     (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \
     (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):
    result = "User wins!"
else:
    result = "Computer wins!"

# Display the result
print(f"User: {user_choice}")
print(f"Computer: {computer_choice}")
print(result)
```

**Your Turn!**

Try to complete the code and run it. Then, modify it to add more features, such as asking the user if they want to play again.

Here's a simple exercise to get you started:

**Exercise:**

You have a list of students who are taking a course. They're a bit mixed up about the course they're taking. They will ask you questions, and you can ask them one question that will help you sort the students into two groups.

1. Ask the student if they're taking a course called "A" or "B".
2. If you ask the question, you can ask the student if they're taking a course called "A" or "B".

**Task: "Guess the Number" Game**

Create a simple "Guess the Number" game where the user has to guess a random integer that is supposed to be a prime number. The game should:

1. Generate a random integer (not a prime number) between 1 and 100, but not 1 (assuming this is a magic number and should be a prime number).
2. Ask the user to guess a number.
3. Check if the user's number is a prime number. If it is, ask if it is the supposed number (i.e. the number that is supposed to be prime but is not). If it is, print "Game Over" and exit. If it is not, print "Not the number, guess again`. If it is not a prime number, print "Not a prime number, guess again`. If the user does not guess the number, print "Not a number, guess again`. If the user does not guess the number and is not a prime number, print "Not a number and not a prime number, guess again`. 

**Task: Implement this game in Python**

**Expected output:**
This should be a simple console application that prompts the user to guess a number and then checks if it is a prime number and if it is the supposed number.

**Python Exercise: Random Number Guessing Game**
================================================

Your task is to create a program that allows users to play a game where they guess a randomly generated number with a high level of accuracy. The program will use a complex algorithm that incorporates mathematical calculations and statistical analysis to provide an optimal solution. The code will be concise, readable, and maintainable.

**Technical Requirements:**

* The program will use a random number generator to generate a number with a high level of accuracy (6 digits).
* The user will be able to input their guess and the program will provide a response with a confidence level (high, low, or low-low) based on the accuracy of the guess.
* The program will use a statistical analysis to determine the accuracy of the guess.
* The program will have a clean and concise code that is easy to read and maintain.
* The program will have a user-friendly interface that is easy to use.
* The program will have a high level of accuracy (less than 0.1% of the number was found to be accurate).
* The program will have a high level of complexity (the use of mathematical calculations and statistical analysis).
* The program will have a high level of security (the use of secure random number generation).
* The program will have a high level of maintainability (the use of clean and concise code).

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
Here's a simple exercise to practice Python:

**Exercise: "Guessing Game"

**Task:** Write a Python program that generates a random number between 1 and 100, and asks the user to guess the number. After each guess, it tells the user if their guess is higher or lower than the actual number. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number.

**Constraints:**

* Use a while loop to keep the game running until the user guesses the number correctly.
* Use a variable to store the randomly generated number.
* Use a variable to store the user's guess.
* Use a conditional statement to determine if the user's guess is higher or lower than the actual number.
* Use a print statement to display the result of each guess.

**Example Output:**

```
Welcome to the guessing game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Guess a number: 
Your guess is too low. Try again!
Guess a number: 
Your guess is too high. Try again!
Guess a number: 
 Congratulations, you guessed it! The number is 50.
```

**Your Task:** Write the Python code for this exercise.

**Hint:** You can use the `random` module to generate a random number.

You can start by importing the `random` module and defining the game logic.
