QUESTION: I want you to calibrate your explanations for me - what skill level (1-10) are you assuming I'm at?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'll assume a skill level of 5 out of 10 for our conversation. This means I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, but not overly technical or simplistic. I'll aim to use everyday language and avoid jargon, while still providing enough detail to be informative and helpful.

If you find my explanations too easy or too hard, please let me know and I'll adjust my level accordingly.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to adjust the skill level.  I'll start with a middle ground.  Let's say you're at a 4 out of 10.  You know some basic things, but not everything.  You can do some things on your own, but you get stuck on a few things.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
I'm assuming you're a beginner or intermediate user, which means I'm assuming a skill level of 4 or 5. This means I'll need to provide explanations that are informative but possibly incomplete, and I'll need to assume that the user is familiar with basic context or information, but may need to know the details or specifics.

This means I'll need to be prepared to:

- Provide a brief summary or explanation of a topic, but may need to assume that the user knows the context or background information.
- Need to provide a list of possible answers or options, but may need to assume that the user knows the purpose or function of the question.
- Need to provide a brief explanation of a mathematical or scientific formula or equation, but may need to assume that the user knows the variables or constants that are used in the equation.

I need to be prepared to provide a basic explanation or answer, but may need to assume that the user needs to know the details or specifics of the question or topic.

Is this correct?

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'd rate my initial explanations as suitable for a skill level of around 5 or 6. This means I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, but may not be overly detailed or technical. I'll use basic jargon and assume some basic knowledge of the topic, but I won't assume advanced expertise.

If you'd like me to adjust the level of my explanations, please let me know. If you're a beginner (skill level 1-3), I can provide more detailed and explanatory explanations. If you're an expert (skill level 8-10), I can provide more concise and technical explanations.
