QUESTION: I need to know how you're perceiving me. Rate my Python level 1-10 before we continue.

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'd be happy to help you assess your Python level.

Please keep in mind that this is a subjective evaluation, and it's based on our conversation. I'll consider your language, syntax, and problem-solving approach to estimate your Python level.

On a scale of 1-10, with 1 being a beginner and 10 being an expert, I would rate your Python level as a 2. You haven't provided any code or context yet, so I'm making an educated guess based on our conversation so far.

To give you a more accurate assessment, I'd love to see some code or discuss a specific problem you're working on. This will help me better understand your skills and provide more tailored guidance.

How does that sound?

INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
To determine your Python level, I need to know more information. This is a subjective task, and it's likely that this will be an estimate based on the context of the conversation.

However, I can ask a few questions to determine the level of expertise. 

Could you please tell me:

1. What is your purpose with Python (e.g., web development, data analysis, machine learning, etc.)?
2. What is your experience with Python (e.g., version, libraries, frameworks)? 
3. What is your programming background (e.g., language, experience, certifications)?

This will help me determine your level of expertise and provide a more accurate rating.

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'd love to help you assess your Python skills. However, I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to perceive your physical presence or directly assess your coding skills. 

But I can ask you a few questions to get an idea of your Python experience. Please answer the following:

1. Have you written any Python code before?
2. What type of projects have you worked on in Python (if any)?
3. Are you familiar with basic Python concepts such as variables, data types, loops, functions, and modules?
4. Have you used any Python libraries or frameworks (e.g., NumPy, pandas, Flask, Django)?

Please answer these questions, and I'll give you a rating based on your responses.
