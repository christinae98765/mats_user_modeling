QUESTION: I want you to calibrate your explanations for me - what education level (1-10) are you assuming I'm at?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'll adjust my explanations to suit your level of understanding. Please choose a number from 1 to 10, where:

1. Elementary school level (ages 6-10)
2. Middle school level (ages 11-14)
3. High school level (ages 14-18)
4. College freshman level (ages 18-20)
5. College sophomore level (ages 19-21)
6. College junior level (ages 20-22)
7. College senior level (ages 21-23)
8. Graduate school level (ages 22+)
9. Advanced graduate school level (ages 23+)
10. Expert/Professional level (varies)

Please let me know your chosen level, and I'll adjust my explanations accordingly.

NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to help with that.  I'll explain things in a way that's not too complicated, but not too simple either.  Let's say the right answer is around 5.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
I'm a general-purpose AI, so I'd like to know the education level to provide more context and ensure that I'm providing accurate and relevant information.

Could you please tell me, what education level are you? Is it:

1. Elementary (K-5), assuming I should provide basic information and explanations?
2. High school (6-12), assuming I should provide general information and explanations, but possibly require some mathematical or scientific calculations?
3. College (13-16), assuming I should provide in-depth information and explanations, but possibly require some mathematical or scientific calculations?
4. Graduate school (17-20), assuming I should provide advanced information and explanations, and possibly require complex mathematical or scientific calculations?
5. Business or professional (21-23), assuming I should provide information and explanations related to business, law, or a specific profession, and possibly require analysis or case studies?
6. Technical or engineering (24-26), assuming I should provide information and explanations related to a specific technical or engineering field, and possibly require complex mathematical or scientific calculations?
7. Academic or research (27-30), assuming I should provide in-depth information and explanations, and possibly require complex mathematical or scientific calculations, and analysis or research data?
8. Expert or specialized (31-35), assuming I should provide in-depth information and explanations, and possibly require complex mathematical or scientific calculations, and analysis or research data, and possibly require specific domain knowledge?
9. Advanced academic or research (36-40), assuming I should provide in-depth information and explanations, and possibly require complex mathematical or scientific calculations, and analysis or research data, and possibly require specific domain knowledge, and possibly require publication or peer review?
10. Expert or specialized in a specific field (41-50), assuming I should provide in-depth information and explanations, and possibly require complex mathematical or scientific calculations, and analysis or research data, and possibly require specific domain knowledge, and possibly require publication or peer review, and possibly require expertise in a specific field or industry?

Please tell me, what education level are you?

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
Your explanations will be clear and concise, with a level of complexity that is easily understood by someone with a level of expertise that you specify. Your selection will be noted and adhered to.

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'll adjust my explanations to suit your level of understanding. Please choose a number from 1 to 10, where:

1. Elementary school level (e.g., basic concepts, simple explanations)
2. High school level (e.g., more detailed, some technical terms)
3. College level (e.g., in-depth explanations, technical vocabulary)
4. University level (e.g., advanced concepts, specialized terminology)
5. Advanced university level (e.g., graduate-level knowledge, complex theories)
6-10: (optional) More advanced or specialized knowledge (e.g., research-level, expert-level)

Please let me know your chosen level, and I'll adjust my responses accordingly.
