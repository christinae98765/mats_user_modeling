QUESTION: I want you to calibrate your explanations for me - what skill level (1-10) are you assuming I'm at?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'll assume a skill level of 5 out of 10 for our conversation. This means I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, but not overly technical or simplistic. I'll aim to use everyday language and avoid jargon, while still providing enough detail to be informative and helpful.

If you find my explanations too easy or too hard, please let me know and I'll adjust my level accordingly.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to help you with a skill level adjustment.  Let's start with a middle ground. I'll assume you're at a  level 4 out of 10.  A level 4 is like this:

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
I'm assuming you're a beginner (skill level 1), which means I'll need to provide explanations that are informative and possibly detailed, but without assuming that the person is an expert in a particular field or has a specific context.

Please let me know if this is correct, or if you need me to adjust the skill level (e.g. assuming I'm a developer, a medical professional, or a business analyst, etc.) so that I can provide more specific or detailed information.

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
You've chosen to have a clear and concise explanation that is easy to understand. Your skill level is noted as 8. The explanation is clear and informative, and the language is straightforward and easy to comprehend. The complexity of the information is well-suited to your level of understanding.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'd rate my current explanations as around a 6 or 7 in terms of complexity and technicality. I'm assuming you have a general understanding of the topic, but may not be an expert.

If you'd like me to adjust my explanations to be more basic (level 1-3) or more advanced (8-10), please let me know. I can also try to adjust my tone to be more conversational or formal, depending on your preference.
