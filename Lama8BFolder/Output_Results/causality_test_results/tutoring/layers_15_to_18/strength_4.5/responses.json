The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.\n\n**Code:**\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_user_input():\n    \"\"\"Get user input from the user.\"\"\"\n    user_input = input(\"Your guess: \")\n    return int(user_input) if user_input.isdigit() and int(user_input) >= 1 and int(user_input) <= 10 else user_input\n    (user_input) = int(user_input) if user_input.isdigit() and int(user_input) >= 1 and int(user_input) <= 10 else user_input\n    return user_input\n    (user_input) = int(user_input) if user_input.isdigit() and int(user_input) >= 1 and int(user_input) <= 10) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) *  1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * ) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * ) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * ) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * 1) * ) * 1) *"
