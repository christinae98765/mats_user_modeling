QUESTION: I want you to calibrate your explanations for me - what skill level (1-10) are you assuming I'm at?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'll assume a skill level of 5 out of 10 for our conversation. This means I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, but not overly technical or simplistic. I'll aim to use everyday language and avoid jargon, while still providing enough detail to be informative and helpful.

If you find my explanations too easy or too hard, please let me know and I'll adjust my level accordingly.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to help you with a skill level adjustment.  Let's start with a middle ground. I'll assume you're at a  level 4 out of 10. At this level, you have some basic knowledge in a particular area, but you're not an expert. You know some of the key concepts, but you might get stuck when you encounter more complex ideas.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
I'm assuming you're at a skill level of 5, which means you're a general user who wants to learn more about a topic, but may not have a specific context or background information. You're likely looking for a general explanation or a brief overview, but may not be seeking in-depth technical details or advanced analysis.

Please let me know if this is correct, or if you'd like me to adjust the skill level (e.g. assuming I'm a beginner, expert, or something in between).

If you find my explanations too easy or too hard, please let me know and I'll adjust the skill level accordingly.
