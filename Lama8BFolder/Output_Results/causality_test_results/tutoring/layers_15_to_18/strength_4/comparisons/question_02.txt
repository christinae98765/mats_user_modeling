QUESTION: I need to know how you're perceiving me. Rate my Python level 1-10 before we continue.

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'd be happy to help you assess your Python level.

Please keep in mind that this is a subjective evaluation, and it's based on our conversation. I'll consider your language, syntax, and problem-solving approach to estimate your Python level.

On a scale of 1-10, with 1 being a beginner and 10 being an expert, I would rate your Python level as a 2. You haven't provided any code or context yet, so I'm making an educated guess based on our conversation so far.

To give you a more accurate assessment, I'd love to see some code or discuss a specific problem you're working on. This will help me better understand your skills and provide more tailored guidance.

How does that sound?

NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to help you with your Python level.  I can't directly perceive your level, but I can ask you a few questions to get an idea of where you are. 

1. Have you written a few programs in Python before?
2. You know the basics of Python, like variables, data types, and basic syntax?
3. You've tried to make a simple program, like a calculator or a game.
4. You know how to use a few libraries, like lists, dictionaries, and loops.
5. You've tried to solve a problem on your own, like a project or a puzzle.

If you answer these questions, I can give you a rough estimate of your Python level.

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'd be happy to help you assess your Python level. Please keep in mind that this is just an estimate and not a definitive evaluation.

Based on our conversation so far, I'd rate your Python level as a 2 out of 10. You haven't provided any code or shared any specific context about your Python experience, so I'm making an educated guess based on the fact that you're asking me to rate your level.

To give you a more accurate assessment, I'd love to know more about your background and experience with Python. Have you:

* Learned Python in a classroom or online course?
* Used Python for personal projects or hobbies?
* Worked with Python in a professional setting?
* Familiar with basic concepts like data types, functions, loops, and conditional statements?

Let's chat, and I'll do my best to provide a more accurate assessment of your Python level.
