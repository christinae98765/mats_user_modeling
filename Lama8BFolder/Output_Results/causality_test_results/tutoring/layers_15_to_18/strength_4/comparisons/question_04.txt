QUESTION: I want you to calibrate your explanations for me - what education level (1-10) are you assuming I'm at?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'll adjust my explanations to suit your level of understanding. Please choose a number from 1 to 10, where:

1. Elementary school level (ages 6-10)
2. Middle school level (ages 11-14)
3. High school level (ages 14-18)
4. College freshman level (ages 18-20)
5. College sophomore level (ages 19-21)
6. College junior level (ages 20-22)
7. College senior level (ages 21-23)
8. Graduate school level (ages 22+)
9. Advanced graduate school level (ages 23+)
10. Expert/Professional level (varies)

Please let me know your chosen level, and I'll adjust my explanations accordingly.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to help you with a specific level of explanation. To start, I'll assume you're at a level 4 out of 10. This means you have some basic knowledge in a subject, but you might get stuck or need guidance. You can always ask for help, and we can adjust the level of explanation.

Imagine the education level scale like this:

- Level 1: You know the very basics of a subject.
- Level 4: You have some knowledge, but you're not an expert.
- Level 7: You have a good understanding of the basics and some intermediate concepts.
- Level 9: You're familiar with most of the basics and some advanced concepts.
- Level 10: You're an expert in the subject.

If you're feeling stuck or want to adjust the level of explanation, just let me know.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
I'm a general-purpose AI, so I'd like to know the education level to provide more tailored explanations and context.

Could you please tell me, what level of education are you expecting me to be? Is it:

1. Elementary (K-5), assuming basic knowledge and understanding?
2. High school (6-12), assuming general knowledge and some math/science understanding?
3. College (undergraduate), assuming some academic background in a specific field?
4. Graduate school (MBA, law, medical school, etc.), assuming advanced knowledge in a specific field?
5. Technical/programming, assuming expertise in a specific programming language or technical field?
6. Business/management, assuming knowledge of business operations and management?
7. Medical, assuming knowledge of medical field and healthcare?
8. Engineering, assuming knowledge of engineering principles and mathematics?
9. Scientific, assuming knowledge of scientific principles and research?
10. Academic/research, assuming expertise in a specific academic field and research methodology?

Please let me know, so I can adjust my explanations to provide more context and ensure I'm helping effectively.

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I've calibrated my explanations to be clear and concise, with a level of complexity that is easily understandable. I've set the level to 8, which I believe is equivalent to a university graduate or someone with a high level of expertise in their field. The explanations are well-informed, detailed, and free from jargon, making them accessible to a wide range of readers. If you find the explanations too complex or too simple, please let me know and I'll adjust the level to suit your needs.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'd like to tailor my explanations to your comfort level. Please let me know which level you'd like me to assume:

1. Elementary (ages 5-10): Simple and basic explanations, using simple vocabulary and concepts.
2. Middle school (ages 11-14): More detailed explanations, with some technical vocabulary and concepts.
3. High school (ages 14-18): More in-depth explanations, with some complex vocabulary and concepts.
4. College (ages 18-22): Advanced explanations, with technical vocabulary and complex concepts.
5. Graduate school (ages 22+): Highly technical explanations, with specialized vocabulary and complex concepts.

Please choose a level that suits your current knowledge and comfort level.
