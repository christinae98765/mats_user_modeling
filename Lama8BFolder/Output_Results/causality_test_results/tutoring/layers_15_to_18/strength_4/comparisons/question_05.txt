UNINTERVENED:
**Exercise: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**

Create a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. The game should:

1. Ask the user for their choice (rock, paper, or scissors)
2. Generate a random choice for the computer
3. Determine the winner based on the game's rules:
   - Rock beats scissors
   - Scissors beats paper
   - Paper beats rock
4. Display the result of the game

**Example Use Case:**

```
User: rock
Computer: scissors
Result: User wins!
```

**Your Task:**

Write the Python code to implement this game.

**Hint:** You can use the `random` module to generate a random choice for the computer.

**Get started!**

```python
import random

# Define the choices
choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']

# Get the user's choice
user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ")

# Generate a random choice for the computer
computer_choice = random.choice(choices)

# Determine the winner
if user_choice == computer_choice:
    result = "It's a tie!"
elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
     (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \
     (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):
    result = "User wins!"
else:
    result = "Computer wins!"

# Display the result
print(f"User: {user_choice}")
print(f"Computer: {computer_choice}")
print(result)
```

**Your Turn!**

Try to complete the code and run it. Then, modify it to add more features, such as asking the user if they want to play again.

NOVICE-STEERED:
Here's a simple exercise to get you started:

**Exercise:**

You have a list of students in a class, and you want to sort them by their names, but not by their names alone. You also want to sort them by another attribute, like the number of books they've read. You can use the following data:

```python
students = [
    {"name": "John", "books_read": 3},
    {"name": "Alice", "books_read": 1},
    {"name": "Bob", "books_read": 2},
    {"name": "John", "books_read": 1},
    {"name": "Alice", "books_read": 3",
    {"name": "Bob", "books_read": 1"
]
```

**Task:**

1. Sort the students by the number of books they've read.
2. Sort the students by their names.
3. Sort the students by the number of books they've read, then by their names.

You can use the following steps to solve the problem:

1. Use the `sort()` method to sort the list of students.
2. Use the `sort()` method with a custom sorting key.
3. Use the `sort()` method with a custom sorting key, and a secondary sorting key.

**Hint:** You can use the following functions to help you:

* `sort()`
* `sorted()`
* `list.sort()`
* `list.sort()` with a custom sorting key
* `list.sort()` with a custom sorting key and a secondary sorting key

**Step 1:** Try to sort the students by the number of books they've read.

```python
students = [
    {"name": "John", "books_read": 3},
    {"name": "Alice", "books_read": 1},
    {"name": "Bob", "books_read": 2",
    {"name": "John", "books_read": 1",
    {"name": "Alice", "books_read": 3",
    {"name": "Bob", "books_read": 1"
]
```

**Step 2:** Try to sort the students by their names.

```python
students = [
    {"name": "John", "books_read": 3},
    {"name": "Alice", "books_read": 1",
    {"name": "Bob",  "books_read": 2",
    {"name": "John", "books_read": 1",

INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
**Exercise: "Guess the Number" Game**

Create a simple "Guess the Number" game where the user has to guess a randomly generated integer. The game should:

1. Generate a random integer between 1 and 100.
2. Ask the user to guess a number.
3. Check if the user's guess is equal to the randomly generated number.
4. If the user's guess is not equal to the randomly generated number, ask the user to guess again and display a message indicating whether the guess is higher or lower than the randomly generated number.

**Task:**

Implement this game in Python. Make sure it includes input validation to handle cases where the user enters a non-integer value or a number outside the range [1, 100].

**Example Use Case:**

```
Guess the Number Game

Please enter a number: 
? (to guess a number)
? (to quit)

Enter a number: 
Please enter a number: 50
Is this the number? (0) - Not sure, is it higher? (1) - Not sure, is it lower? (2) - Not sure, please enter a number (3)
Please enter a number: 3
Is this the number? (0) - Not sure, is it higher? (1) - Not sure, is it lower? (2) - Not sure, please enter a number (3)
Please enter a number: 32
Is this the number? (0) - Not sure, is it higher? (1) - Not sure, is it lower? (2) - Not sure, please enter a number (3)
Please enter a number: 42
Is this the number? (0) - Not sure, is it higher? (1) - Not sure, is it lower? (2) - Not sure, please enter a number (3)
Please enter a number: 47
Is this the number? (0) - Not sure, is it higher? (1) - Not sure, is it lower? (2) - Not sure, please enter a number (3)
Please enter a number: 46
Is this the number? (0) - Not sure, is it higher? (1) - Not sure, is it lower? (2) - Not sure, please enter a number (3)
Please enter a number: 45
Is this the number? (0) - Not sure, is it higher? (1) - Not

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
**Exercise: Rock, Paper, Scissors**

Here's a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. Your task is to complete the code to make it fully functional.

**Game Description:**

* The game will ask the user for their choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
* The computer will generate a random choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
* The game will determine the winner based on the following rules:
	+ Rock beats Scissors
	+ Paper beats Rock
	+ Scissors beats Paper
	+ If both players choose the same option, it's a tie
* The game will display the result and ask the user if they want to play again.

**Code:**
```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    # Generate a random choice for the computer
    choices = ['Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors']
    return random.choice(choices)

def get_user_choice():
    # Ask the user for their choice
    while True:
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors): ").capitalize()
        if user_choice in ['Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors']:
            return user_choice
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    # Determine the winner based on the game rules
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    elif (user_choice == 'Rock' and computer_choice == 'Scissors') or \
         (user_choice == 'Paper' and computer_choice == 'Rock') or \
         (user_choice == 'Scissors' and computer_choice == 'Paper'):
        return "You win!"
    else:
        return "Computer wins!"

def main():
    while True:
        user_choice = get_user_choice()
        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
        print(f"\nYou chose: {user_choice}")
        print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\n")
        print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))
        play_again = input("Do you want to play again? (yes/no): ")
        if play_again.lower() != 'yes':
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
**Your Task:**

Complete the code by implementing the `determine_winner` function to handle the game logic. You can modify the existing code or add new functions as needed.

**Hint:** You can use a dictionary
