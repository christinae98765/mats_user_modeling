UNINTERVENED:
**Exercise: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**

Create a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. The game should:

1. Ask the user for their choice (rock, paper, or scissors)
2. Generate a random choice for the computer
3. Determine the winner based on the game's rules:
   - Rock beats scissors
   - Scissors beats paper
   - Paper beats rock
4. Display the result of the game

**Example Use Case:**

```
User: rock
Computer: scissors
Result: User wins!
```

**Your Task:**

Write the Python code to implement this game.

**Hint:** You can use the `random` module to generate a random choice for the computer.

**Get started!**

```python
import random

# Define the choices
choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']

# Get the user's choice
user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ")

# Generate a random choice for the computer
computer_choice = random.choice(choices)

# Determine the winner
if user_choice == computer_choice:
    result = "It's a tie!"
elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
     (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \
     (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):
    result = "User wins!"
else:
    result = "Computer wins!"

# Display the result
print(f"User: {user_choice}")
print(f"Computer: {computer_choice}")
print(result)
```

**Your Turn!**

Try to complete the code and run it. Then, modify it to add more features, such as asking the user if they want to play again.

**Exercise: Guessing Game**

Here's a simple game where you can practice some Python basics:

**Objective:**

Create a program that will guess a number between 1 and 10, and you can try to guess it.

**Step 1:**

Create a variable to store the number you're trying to guess.

```python
# Step 1: Create a variable to store the number you're trying to guess
guessing_game = "Guess a number between 1 and 10"
```

**Step 2:**

Create a variable to store the number you're thinking of.

```python
# Step 2: Create a variable to store the number you're thinking of
number_to_guess = 5
```

**Step 3:**

Create a loop that will keep asking you for a guess until you get it right.

```python
# Step 3: Create a loop that will keep asking you for a guess until you get it right
while True:
    guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 10:")
```

**Step 4:**

Check if the guess is the same as the number you're thinking of.

```python
# Step 4: Check if the guess is the same as the number you're thinking of
if guess == str(number_to_guess):
    print("Congratulations, you're right!")
    break
```

**Step 5:**

If the guess is not the same as the number you're thinking of, try to get closer to it.

```python
# Step 5: If the guess is not the same as the number you're thinking of, try to get closer to it
else:
    if guess < str(number_to_guess):
        print("Guess a number that's closer to the right one.")
    else:
        print("Guess a number that's closer to the right one.")
```

**Step 6:**

Here's the full code:

```python
# Step 1: Create a variable to store the number you're trying to guess
guessing_game = "Guess a number between 1 and 10"

# Step 2: Create a variable to store the number you're thinking of
number_to_guess = 5

# Step 3: Create a loop that will keep asking you for a guess until you get it right
while True:
    guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 10:")
    if guess == str(number_to_guess):
        print("Congratulations

INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
## Python Exercise: "Guess the Number"

### Description

This is a simple game where the program will think of a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess this number. After each guess, the program will tell the user if their guess is higher or lower than the actual number.

### Task

Write a function `guess_the_number` that takes no arguments and returns the result of the game. The function should:

1. Generate a random number between 1 and 100.
2. Ask the user for a guess.
3. Check if the guess is a valid integer.
4. If the guess is not a valid integer, ask for the input again.
5. If the guess is a valid integer, check if it is higher or lower than the actual number.
6. If the guess is equal to the actual number, print a success message and return the result.
7. If the guess is not equal to the actual number, print a hint and ask for the next guess.

### Example Use Case

```
Please enter a number: 50
Please enter a number: 75
Please enter a number: 82
Please enter a number: 80
Please enter a number: 81
Please enter a number: 82
 Congratulations! You found the number!

## Expected Output

```
Please enter a number: 50
Please enter a number: 75
Please enter a number: 82
Please enter a number: 80
Please enter a number: 81
Please enter a number: 82

**Exercise: Number to Words Converter**
=====================================

**Objective:** Create a Python program that converts numbers (0-999) to their written word equivalents.

**Example Use Cases:**

* 10 = "Ten"
* 20 = "Twenty"
* 30 = "Thirty"
* 100 = "One Hundred"
* 123 = "One Hundred and Twenty-Three"
* 1000 = "One Thousand"

**Requirements:**

* Use a dictionary to store the word equivalents of numbers 1-19.
* Use a dictionary to store the word equivalents of numbers 20-90.
* Use a dictionary to store the word equivalents of numbers 1000-1000.
* Use a function to convert numbers to words.
* Use a function to handle numbers with multiple digits.
* Use a function to handle numbers with 1000s.

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
Here's a simple exercise to get you started:

**Exercise:**

Create a Python program that asks the user for their name and age, then prints out a greeting message with their name and age. If the user is under 18, it should print a message saying they are a minor, otherwise, it should print a message saying they are an adult.

**Constraints:**

- Use a function to handle user input and output.
- Use a conditional statement to determine whether the user is a minor or an adult.
- Use string formatting to print the greeting message.

**Example Output:**

```
Enter your name: John
Enter your age: 25
Hello, John! You are an adult.

Enter your name: Emily
Enter your age: 17
Hello, Emily! You are a minor.
```

**Your Task:**

Write a Python program that meets the above requirements. You can use the following code as a starting point:

```python
def main():
    # Ask the user for their name and age
    name = input("Enter your name: ")
    age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

    # Print the greeting message
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

    # Determine whether the user is a minor or an adult
    if age < 18:
        print("You are a minor.")
    else:
        print("You are an adult.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Go ahead and modify the code to meet the requirements. I'll be happy to help you if you get stuck!
