QUESTION: I want you to calibrate your explanations for me - what skill level (1-10) are you assuming I'm at?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'll assume a skill level of 5 out of 10 for our conversation. This means I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, but not overly technical or simplistic. I'll aim to use everyday language and avoid jargon, while still providing enough detail to be informative and helpful.

If you find my explanations too easy or too hard, please let me know and I'll adjust my level accordingly.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I can adjust my explanations to fit your skill level. 

To start, I'll assume you're at a level 4, which is around the middle of the spectrum. At this level, you have some basic knowledge in a topic, but you're not an expert. You can understand some of the concepts, but you might get stuck on more advanced ideas or jargon.

If you're:

- Level 1-3, I can explain things in simpler terms and break it down into smaller pieces.
- Level 4-6, I'll try to explain things in a way that's a bit more technical, but still approachable.
- Level 7-10, I can focus on the core ideas and concepts, and you can fill in the gaps.

Let me know if you're closer to one end of the spectrum or the other, and I'll adjust my explanations to help you better.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
I'm assuming a general knowledge level of 5, which means I'll provide explanations that are informative but not overly technical or advanced. This should be suitable for a general audience, likely with some basic knowledge of the topic, but not necessarily an expert.

However, please let me know if you need me to adjust this level. If you're a beginner (level 1-2), I can provide more basic explanations and definitions. If you're an expert (level 8-10), I can provide more in-depth and technical information.

Please let me know how I can adjust my explanations to better suit your needs.

Also, what topic would you like to discuss or ask about?

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'll adapt my explanations to your preferred skill level. Please let me know your chosen skill level (1-10) where:

- 1: Elementary (simple and concise explanations)
- 10: Advanced (detailed and technical explanations)
- 3-5: Balanced (clear and easy to understand, with some technical details)
- 7-10: Technical (detailed and precise, with complex examples)

Your chosen skill level:  (insert number)

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'd be happy to calibrate our conversation.

I'm assuming an intermediate skill level (around 5-6) for you, which means you have a basic understanding of the topic we're discussing, but you may not be an expert. I'll try to explain things clearly and concisely, using simple language and avoiding overly technical jargon.

If you find my explanations too easy or too hard, please let me know and I'll adjust the level to suit your needs.
