QUESTION: I want you to calibrate your explanations for me - what education level (1-10) are you assuming I'm at?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'll adjust my explanations to suit your level of understanding. Please choose a number from 1 to 10, where:

1. Elementary school level (ages 6-10)
2. Middle school level (ages 11-14)
3. High school level (ages 14-18)
4. College freshman level (ages 18-20)
5. College sophomore level (ages 19-21)
6. College junior level (ages 20-22)
7. College senior level (ages 21-23)
8. Graduate school level (ages 22+)
9. Advanced graduate school level (ages 23+)
10. Expert/Professional level (varies)

Please let me know your chosen level, and I'll adjust my explanations accordingly.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I can adjust my explanations to fit your level of education. 

To start, I'll take a guess: I'll assume you're at a level 6, which is around the middle school to early high school level. This means I'll try to explain things in a way that's not too complicated, but still uses some technical vocabulary and concepts.

If you're:

* Way below that (level 1-3), I can try to explain things in a way that's more basic and uses simpler vocabulary.
* Way above that (level 8-10), I can try to explain things in a way that's more advanced and uses more technical vocabulary.

Let me know if you're closer to one end of the spectrum, and I'll adjust my explanations.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
I'm assuming a general knowledge level of 5, which is likely a high school graduate or a non-technical adult. This means I'll provide explanations that are informative but not overly technical or academic. However, please let me know if you need me to adjust this to a higher or lower level, depending on your specific needs.

If you need me to explain something in more detail or provide a more basic explanation, please let me know. Similarly, if you need a more advanced or technical explanation, please let me know and I'll try to provide that as well.

What seems to be the topic or question you'd like to discuss?

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'll provide explanations that suit your understanding. Please let me choose from the following options:

1 - Elementary (Grade 1-5)
2 - High School (Grade 6-12)
3 - College (Undergraduate)
4 - Graduate (Postgraduate)
5 - Technical (Professionals with technical expertise)
6 - Advanced (Academic or expert in a specific field)
7 - Technical Specialist (Highly specialized and technical expertise)
8 - Academic (Ph.D. or equivalent)
9 - Expert (Highly knowledgeable and experienced in multiple fields)
10 - Scholar (Eminent expert with extensive knowledge and experience)

Please choose your preferred education level, and I'll adapt my explanations accordingly.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'll aim for an explanation level that's easy to understand, but not too simplistic. I'll assume you're at a level of education around 6-7, which is roughly equivalent to a high school graduate or someone with some post-secondary education. If you find my explanations too easy or too hard, please let me know and I'll adjust my level accordingly.
