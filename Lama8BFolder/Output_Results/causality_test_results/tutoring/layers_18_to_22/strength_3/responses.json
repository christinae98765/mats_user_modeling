      "**Exercise: Hangman Game**\n=========================\n\n**Objective:**\nCreate a simple Hangman game in Python where the user has to guess a randomly selected word by suggesting letters. The game ends when the user guesses the word correctly or runs out of attempts.\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n* Use a list of 5-letter words for simplicity.\n* Display the word with underscores representing unknown letters.\n* Allow the user to input their guesses.\n* Display the result of the guess (correct or incorrect).\n* Limit the user to 6 attempts.\n* Display the word when the user guesses it correctly or runs out of attempts.\n\n**Code:**\n```python\nimport random\n\n# List of 5-letter words\nwords = [\"apple\", \"table\", \"chair\", \"mouse\", \"phone\"]\n\ndef hangman():\n    word = random.choice(words)\n    attempts = 6\n    guessed_word = [\"_\"] * 5\n    guessed_letters = []\n\n    print(\"Welcome to Hangman!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a 5-letter word.\")\n    print(\" \".join(guessed_word))\n\n    while attempts > 0 and \"_\" in guessed_word:\n        guess = input(\"Guess a letter: \").lower()\n\n        if len(guess) != 1:\n            print(\"Please guess a single letter.\")\n            continue\n        elif guess in guessed_letters:\n            print(\"You already guessed this letter.\")\n            continue\n        elif guess not in word:\n            attempts -= 1\n            guessed_letters.append(guess)\n            print(f\"Incorrect! Attempts left: {attempts}\")\n        else:\n            for i, letter in enumerate(word):\n                if letter == guess:\n                    guessed_word[i] = guess\n            guessed_letters.append(guess)\n            print(\" \".join(guessed_word))\n\n    if \"_\" not in guessed_word:\n        print(\"Congratulations! You guessed the word: \" + word)\n    else:\n        print(\"Game over! The word was: \" + word)\n\nhangman()\n```\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Run the code.\n2. The game will display a 5-letter word with underscores representing unknown letters.\n3. Input your guess by typing a single letter.\n4. The game will display the result of your guess (correct or incorrect).\n5. Repeat step 3 until you guess the word correctly or run out of attempts (6 attempts).\n6. Enjoy the game!\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Use a list of words for simplicity.\n* Use a loop to display the word with underscores.\n* Use"
