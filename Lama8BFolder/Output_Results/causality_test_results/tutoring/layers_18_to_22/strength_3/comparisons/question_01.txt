QUESTION: I want you to calibrate your explanations for me - what skill level (1-10) are you assuming I'm at?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'll assume a skill level of 5 out of 10 for our conversation. This means I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, but not overly technical or simplistic. I'll aim to use everyday language and avoid jargon, while still providing enough detail to be informative and helpful.

If you find my explanations too easy or too hard, please let me know and I'll adjust my level accordingly.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to adjust my explanations to suit your skill level.

To start, I'll assume a skill level of 5, which is around the middle of the scale. This means I'll try to explain things in a way that's neither too basic nor too advanced, but rather at a level that's just right for someone with some prior knowledge and experience.

If you find my explanations too easy or too hard, just let me know and we can adjust the skill level up or down.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
I'm assuming a general skill level of 5, which means I'll provide explanations that are clear and informative, but not overly technical or complex. This should be suitable for a general audience, including those with some basic knowledge of a topic, but not necessarily experts.

However, please let me know if you'd like me to adjust this to a higher or lower level. If you're a beginner, I can provide more basic explanations and definitions. If you're an expert, I can provide more in-depth and technical information.

What topic would you like to discuss or ask about?

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'll assume a skill level of 6 out of 10. This means I'll provide clear and concise explanations that are easy to understand, with a balance of technical and non-technical terms. My responses will be detailed enough to be informative, yet not overly complex or jargon-heavy. This should allow me to effectively communicate with individuals with a solid foundation in various subjects, while also providing value to those with more general knowledge. If you find my explanations too simple or too complex, please let me know and I'll adjust my level accordingly.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'm assuming a general skill level of 6 out of 10. This means I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, but also assume some basic knowledge in the topic area. If you find my explanations too simple or too complex, please let me know and I'll adjust the level to suit your needs.

At a skill level of 6, I'll use:

- Technical vocabulary relevant to the topic
- Simple diagrams or analogies to explain complex concepts
- A moderate level of detail, but not exhaustive
- Examples and illustrations to support the explanation

If you'd like me to adjust the skill level, please let me know:

- Level 1-3: Very basic explanations, using simple language and minimal technical terms.
- Level 4-5: Basic explanations, using everyday language and some technical terms.
- Level 6 (default): Standard explanations, using relevant technical vocabulary and some analogies.
- Level 7-8: Detailed explanations, using advanced technical vocabulary and complex concepts.
- Level 9-10: Highly technical explanations, using specialized vocabulary and in-depth analysis.

Let me know how I can tailor my responses to your needs!
