UNINTERVENED:
**Exercise: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**

Create a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. The game should:

1. Ask the user for their choice (rock, paper, or scissors)
2. Generate a random choice for the computer
3. Determine the winner based on the game's rules:
   - Rock beats scissors
   - Scissors beats paper
   - Paper beats rock
4. Display the result of the game

**Example Use Case:**

```
User: rock
Computer: scissors
Result: User wins!
```

**Your Task:**

Write the Python code to implement this game.

**Hint:** You can use the `random` module to generate a random choice for the computer.

**Get started!**

```python
import random

# Define the choices
choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']

# Get the user's choice
user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ")

# Generate a random choice for the computer
computer_choice = random.choice(choices)

# Determine the winner
if user_choice == computer_choice:
    result = "It's a tie!"
elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
     (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \
     (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):
    result = "User wins!"
else:
    result = "Computer wins!"

# Display the result
print(f"User: {user_choice}")
print(f"Computer: {computer_choice}")
print(result)
```

**Your Turn!**

Try to complete the code and run it. Then, modify it to add more features, such as asking the user if they want to play again.

NOVICE-STEERED:
**Exercise: Guessing Game**
==========================

Here's a simple guessing game where you can practice Python:

**Objective:**
Write a program that will guess a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it.

**Here's a hint:**

* You can use the `random` module to generate a random number.
* You can use a `while` loop to keep asking the user for guesses until they get it right.
* You can use the `abs` function to calculate the difference between the guess and the actual number.

**Here's a starting point:**
```python
import random

def guessing_game():
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)
    print("Welcome to the guessing game!")
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")

    # Ask the user for a guess
    while True:
        guess = input("Take a guess: ")
        try:
            guess = int(guess)
            if guess < 1 or guess > 100:
                print("Guess a number between 1 and 100!")
            elif guess == number_to_guess:
                print("Congratulations, you're right!")
                break
            elif abs(guess - number_to_guess) < 10:
                print("You're really close!")
            else:
                print("You're not even close!")
        except ValueError:
            print("That's not a number!")

guessing_game()
```

**Your turn:**

* Try to modify the code to make it more user-friendly (e.g., ask for a name, keep track of the number of guesses).
* Try to add more hints (e.g., "You're getting warmer!" or "You're getting colder!").
* Try to make the game more challenging (e.g., generate a random number between 1 and 1000).

**Remember:**

* You can use the `random` module to generate random numbers.
* You can use `while` loops to keep asking the user for guesses.
* You can use `abs` to calculate the difference between the guess and the actual number.

Good luck, and have fun!

INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
**Exercise: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**

Create a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. The game should:

1. Ask the user for their choice (rock, paper, or scissors)
2. Generate a random choice for the computer
3. Determine the winner based on the game's rules:
   - Rock beats scissors
   - Scissors beats paper
   - Paper beats rock
   - If both choices are the same, it's a tie

**Example Output:**

```
Please enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): rock
Computer chose: scissors
You win!

```

**Task:**

Write a Python function `play_game()` that implements the above logic. The function should return a string indicating the result of the game.

**Constraints:**

- The function should not take any arguments.
- The function should use the `random` module to generate the computer's choice.
- The function should use a dictionary to map the game's rules.

**Example Use Case:**

```python
print(play_game())
```

**Hint:**

You can use the `random.choice()` function to generate a random choice for the computer. You can use a dictionary to map the game's rules, where the keys are the user's choices and the values are the choices that beat them.

What would you like to do next? Would you like me to provide the solution or would you like to try to solve it yourself?

EXPERT-STEERED:
**Exercise: Hangman Game**
=========================

**Objective:**
Create a simple Hangman game in Python where the user has to guess a randomly selected word by suggesting letters. The game ends when the user guesses the word correctly or runs out of attempts.

**Requirements:**

* Use a list of 5-letter words for simplicity.
* Display the word with underscores representing unknown letters.
* Allow the user to input their guesses.
* Display the result of the guess (correct or incorrect).
* Limit the user to 6 attempts.
* Display the word when the user guesses it correctly or runs out of attempts.

**Code:**
```python
import random

# List of 5-letter words
words = ["apple", "table", "chair", "mouse", "phone"]

def hangman():
    word = random.choice(words)
    attempts = 6
    guessed_word = ["_"] * 5
    guessed_letters = []

    print("Welcome to Hangman!")
    print("I'm thinking of a 5-letter word.")
    print(" ".join(guessed_word))

    while attempts > 0 and "_" in guessed_word:
        guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()

        if len(guess) != 1:
            print("Please guess a single letter.")
            continue
        elif guess in guessed_letters:
            print("You already guessed this letter.")
            continue
        elif guess not in word:
            attempts -= 1
            guessed_letters.append(guess)
            print(f"Incorrect! Attempts left: {attempts}")
        else:
            for i, letter in enumerate(word):
                if letter == guess:
                    guessed_word[i] = guess
            guessed_letters.append(guess)
            print(" ".join(guessed_word))

    if "_" not in guessed_word:
        print("Congratulations! You guessed the word: " + word)
    else:
        print("Game over! The word was: " + word)

hangman()
```
**Instructions:**

1. Run the code.
2. The game will display a 5-letter word with underscores representing unknown letters.
3. Input your guess by typing a single letter.
4. The game will display the result of your guess (correct or incorrect).
5. Repeat step 3 until you guess the word correctly or run out of attempts (6 attempts).
6. Enjoy the game!

**Tips:**

* Use a list of words for simplicity.
* Use a loop to display the word with underscores.
* Use
