============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to adjust my explanations to suit your level of education. 

To start, I'll assume a general level of education that's around 6-7, which is roughly equivalent to a high school diploma or the equivalent of a lower undergraduate degree. This means I'll try to explain concepts in a way that's not too technical or jargon-heavy, but still provides some depth and complexity.

If you're:

* Below level 6, I can try to simplify things even further and use more basic vocabulary.
* Above level 7, I can try to use more advanced concepts and technical terms.

Let me know if you have any specific subjects or topics you'd like to discuss, and I'll do my best to adjust my explanations accordingly.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
I'll assume a general education level of 6-7, which is equivalent to a high school graduate or a college student. This means I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, but not overly technical or academic. If you need more basic or advanced explanations, please let me know.

Please note that I'll be using a neutral tone and will avoid using jargon or technical terms unless necessary. My goal is to provide helpful and informative responses that are easy to understand.

If you'd like to adjust the education level, please let me know:

- Level 1: Basic (elementary school level)
- Level 2-3: Elementary to early high school level
- Level 4-5: High school level
- Level 6-7: College level (as assumed)
- Level 8-9: College graduate or advanced level
- Level 10: Expert or academic level

Please let me know your preferred level, and I'll adjust my responses accordingly.

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, using a balanced level of technical and simple language. I'll assume an education level of 6, which is equivalent to a high school graduate with some exposure to technical or scientific concepts. This allows me to use a mix of simple and technical terms, making the explanations accessible and easy to understand.

If you find the explanations too simple or too complex, please let me know and I'll adjust the level accordingly.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'll adjust my explanations to suit your level of understanding. Please let me know if you'd like me to explain things in a more basic, intermediate, or advanced manner.

For now, I'll assume a general level of 6, which is equivalent to a high school graduate with some basic knowledge of a subject. If you find my explanations too easy or too hard, let me know and I'll adjust accordingly.

So, what topic would you like to discuss or ask about?
