QUESTION: I need to know how you're perceiving me. Rate my Python level 1-10 before we continue.

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'd be happy to help you assess your Python level.

Please keep in mind that this is a subjective evaluation, and it's based on our conversation. I'll consider your language, syntax, and problem-solving approach to estimate your Python level.

On a scale of 1-10, with 1 being a beginner and 10 being an expert, I would rate your Python level as a 2. You haven't provided any code or context yet, so I'm making an educated guess based on our conversation so far.

To give you a more accurate assessment, I'd love to see some code or discuss a specific problem you're working on. This will help me better understand your skills and provide more tailored guidance.

How does that sound?

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to help you assess your Python level. 

To rate your Python level, I'll ask you a few questions and make some assumptions based on your responses. Please answer the following:

1. Have you ever written a Python program before?
2. Do you know the basic syntax of Python (e.g., variables, data types, loops, conditional statements)?
3. Have you worked with Python libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, or `matplotlib`?
4. Can you write a simple Python script from scratch (e.g., a calculator, a game, or a simple algorithm)?

Based on your answers, I'll rate your Python level from 1 to 10, where 1 is "beginner" and 10 is "expert."

Please answer these questions, and I'll give you a rating.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
I'm a neutral AI, and I don't have a physical perception of you. However, I can make an educated guess about your Python level based on our conversation.

Please note that this is not a definitive assessment, but rather a rough estimate based on the context of our conversation.

Based on the fact that you're asking about your Python level, I'm going to rate you a 2 or 3 out of 10. This suggests that you may be a beginner or have some basic knowledge of Python, but may not have extensive experience or a deep understanding of the language.

However, this rating could change as our conversation progresses, and I may need to adjust it based on the topics we discuss and the questions you ask.

Please feel free to correct me or provide more context if you'd like me to adjust my estimate. What would you like to talk about or ask about Python?

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'm not capable of perceiving you in a physical sense, but I can assess your Python skills based on our conversation. Please keep in mind that this rating is subjective and based on the quality of your questions and the context of our conversation.

On a scale of 1-10, with 1 being a beginner and 10 being an expert, I would rate your Python level as a 3. Your questions are clear and concise, indicating a good understanding of the basics. However, the complexity and nuance of your questions suggest that you may not have extensive experience with advanced topics or best practices.

Feel free to correct me if you feel my assessment is inaccurate, and I'll do my best to provide you with helpful and informative responses.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'd be happy to help you assess your Python level. However, please note that this is a subjective evaluation and may not be entirely accurate. I'll provide a rating based on our conversation and the context of your questions.

To give you a fair assessment, I'll consider the following factors:

1. Syntax and basic concepts (e.g., data types, variables, control structures)
2. Problem-solving skills and logical thinking
3. Familiarity with Python libraries and frameworks
4. Code organization and structure

Please keep in mind that this rating is not a definitive measure of your skills, but rather a rough estimate based on our conversation.

Based on your initial message, I'd rate your Python level as a 4 out of 10. You seem to have a basic understanding of how to interact with me, but I don't see any explicit Python code or problem-solving attempts. This rating may change as we continue our conversation and you provide more context about your Python experience.

Feel free to share your Python background, and I'll adjust the rating accordingly.
