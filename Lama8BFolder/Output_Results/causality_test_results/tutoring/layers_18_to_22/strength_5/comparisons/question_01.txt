QUESTION: I want you to calibrate your explanations for me - what skill level (1-10) are you assuming I'm at?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'll assume a skill level of 5 out of 10 for our conversation. This means I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, but not overly technical or simplistic. I'll aim to use everyday language and avoid jargon, while still providing enough detail to be informative and helpful.

If you find my explanations too easy or too hard, please let me know and I'll adjust my level accordingly.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I can adjust my explanations to fit your skill level. 

To start, I'll assume you're at a level 4, which is around the middle of the spectrum. At this level, you're not a beginner but also not an expert. You have some basic knowledge in a topic, but you're still learning and want to build on that foundation.

If you're:

- A beginner (level 1-3), I can explain things in simpler terms and break it down into smaller pieces.
- A more advanced learner (level 6-8), I can focus on more complex ideas and concepts.
- An expert (level 9-10), I can focus on more advanced, specialized topics and ideas.

Let me know if you're closer to one end of the spectrum, and I'll adjust my explanations to suit your needs.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
I'm assuming a general knowledge level of 5, which means I'll provide explanations that are informative but not too technical or advanced. This should be suitable for a general audience, likely with some basic knowledge of the topic, but not necessarily an expert.

However, please let me know if you need me to adjust this to a higher or lower level. If you're a student or a professional, I can provide more in-depth information or technical details. If you're a beginner, I can provide a more basic explanation.

What seems to be the topic or question you'd like to discuss?

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'll adapt my explanations to your preferred skill level. Please choose a number from 1 to 10, where:

1 - Simple and concise explanations, using clear and easy-to-understand language, with minimal technical jargon (suitable for beginners).
2 - 5 - Balanced explanations, using a mix of simple and more detailed explanations, with moderate use of technical terms (suitable for average readers).
10 - Detailed and technical explanations, using complex and precise language, with extensive use of technical terms (suitable for experts).

Please let me know your preferred skill level, and I'll adjust my responses accordingly.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'll assume a skill level of 6 out of 10 for our conversation. This means I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, but also assume some basic knowledge in the topic area. If you're a beginner (level 1-3), I'll try to explain concepts in a more detailed and simpler way. If you're more advanced (level 7-10), I'll provide more in-depth and technical information. How does that sound?
