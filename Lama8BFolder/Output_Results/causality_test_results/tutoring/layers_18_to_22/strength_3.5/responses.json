Also, add a `print` statement to print the prompt for the initial guess.\n\n### Hint\n\nThe `input` function in Python requires a closing parenthesis to complete the function call. The `elif` statement is used to check if the user's guess is higher or lower than the generated number.\n\n### Expected Output\n\nThe game should continue to prompt the user to guess the number until they guess the correct number.

      "**Exercise: Hangman Game**\n=========================\n\n**Objective:**\nCreate a simple Hangman game using Python. The game will randomly select a word from a list, and the user will have to guess the word by suggesting letters. The user will have a limited number of attempts (6 in this case). The game will display the word with underscores representing the unknown letters, and the user's score will be displayed at the end.\n\n**Code:**\n```python\nimport random\n\n# List of words to choose from\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"date\", \"elderberry\"]\n\ndef hangman():\n    # Select a random word from the list\n    word = random.choice(words)\n    word_length = len(word)\n    display = [\"_\"] * word_length\n    score = 6\n    guessed = False\n    guessed_word = []\n    guessed_letters = []\n\n    while score > 0 and not guessed:\n        print(f\"Score: {score}\")\n        print(\" \".join(display))\n        print(\"Guessed letters: \", \" \".join(guessed_letters))\n        letter = input(\"Guess a letter: \").lower()\n\n        if len(letter) != 1:\n            print(\"Please enter a single letter.\")\n            continue\n        if letter in guessed_letters:\n            print(\"You've already guessed this letter.\")\n            continue\n        guessed_letters.append(letter)\n        if letter in word:\n            for i in range(word_length):\n                if word[i] == letter:\n                    display[i] = letter\n            if \"_\" not in display:\n                guessed = True\n                print(\"Congratulations! You won!\")\n        else:\n            score -= 1\n            print(f\"Score: {score}\")\n            print(\"Incorrect! The letter is not in the word.\")\n        if score == 0:\n            print(\"Game over! The word was: \" + word)\n            print(\"Thanks for playing!\")\n    if score > 0:\n        print(\"Thanks for playing!\")\n\nhangman()\n```\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Run the code.\n2. The game will display the word with underscores representing the unknown letters.\n3. Enter a letter by typing it in.\n4. The game will display the word with the guessed letter(s) in the correct position(s).\n5. If the letter is not in the word, the score will decrease by 1.\n6. If the score reaches 0, the game will end and display the word.\n7. If the user guesses the word correctly"
