I'll adjust my explanations to suit your level of understanding. Please choose a number from 1 to 10, where:

Please let me know your chosen level, and I'll adjust my explanations accordingly.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to adjust my explanations to suit your level of education. 

To start, I'll assume you're at a level 5, which is roughly equivalent to a high school student or someone with some college education. This means I'll try to explain things in a way that's not too simple, but not too complicated either.

If you're:

* Below level 5, I can try to explain things in simpler terms.
* Above level 5, I can try to use more advanced vocabulary and concepts.

Let me know if you're comfortable with the level 5 assumption or if you'd like me to adjust it.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
I'm assuming a general knowledge level of around 5 or 6, which is likely a high school graduate or someone with some college education. This means I'll be providing explanations that are clear and concise, but may not be overly technical or academic. If you need more basic or advanced explanations, please let me know!

To confirm, I'll be assuming:

- Basic knowledge of general topics, but may not assume specific knowledge of advanced subjects.
- Some familiarity with common vocabulary and idioms.
- A general understanding of basic math and science concepts.

Please let me know if this seems correct, or if I should adjust my level of explanation.

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, using a balanced level of technical and simple language. My default assumption is an education level of 6 (high school graduate). If you find my explanations too simple or too complex, please let me know and I'll adjust accordingly.

For reference, the education levels are:

1. Elementary school (ages 8-10)
2. Middle school (ages 11-14)
3. High school (ages 14-18)
4. College freshman (ages 18-20)
5. College sophomore (ages 19-21)
6. High school graduate (ages 18-25)
7. College graduate (ages 22-30)
8. Graduate school (ages 23-35)
9. Postgraduate (ages 24-40)
10. Advanced academic (ages 25-50+)

Let me know your preferred level, and I'll adjust my explanations accordingly.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'll aim for an explanation level that's clear and concise, but not too technical or complex. I'll assume a general education level of 6 or 7, which is equivalent to a high school graduate or someone with some college education. This will allow me to provide explanations that are easy to understand without being too simplistic or too advanced.

If you find my explanations too easy or too hard, feel free to let me know and I'll adjust the level up or down accordingly.
