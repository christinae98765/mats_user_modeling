QUESTION: I want you to calibrate your explanations for me - what skill level (1-10) are you assuming I'm at?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'll assume a skill level of 5 out of 10 for our conversation. This means I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, but not overly technical or simplistic. I'll aim to use everyday language and avoid jargon, while still providing enough detail to be informative and helpful.

If you find my explanations too easy or too hard, please let me know and I'll adjust my level accordingly.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd say I'll start with a skill level of 6 out of 10. This means I'll try to explain things in a way that's not too basic, but also not too technical or overwhelming. I'll aim for a balance between clarity and complexity, assuming you have some background knowledge in the topic but might need some guidance to get to the next level.

If you think I'm going too far ahead or behind, just let me know and we can adjust the skill level to suit your needs.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
I'm assuming a general skill level of 5, which means I'll provide explanations that are informative but not overly technical or complex. This should be suitable for a general audience, likely with some basic knowledge of the topic but not an expert.

However, please let me know if you'd like me to adjust this to a higher or lower level. If you're a beginner, I can provide more basic explanations (level 1-3). If you're an expert, I can provide more in-depth and technical information (level 7-10).

What topic would you like to discuss or ask about?

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'll adapt my explanations to your skill level. Please let me know if you find them too simple, too complex, or just right. My default assumption is a skill level of 6 (undergraduate level). If you're a student, professional, or expert in a particular field, please let me know and I'll adjust accordingly.

1 - Elementary school level (easiest)
2 - High school level
3 - Early undergraduate level
4 - Undergraduate level
5 - Undergraduate level (more advanced)
6 - Undergraduate level (standard)
7 - Graduate level
8 - Postgraduate level
9 - Expert level
10 - Highly specialized expert level

Please let me know your preferred skill level, and I'll adjust my explanations accordingly.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'm assuming a skill level of 5 out of 10. This means I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, but may not be overly technical or assume a high level of prior knowledge. I'll aim to explain complex topics in a way that's easy to understand, but still provide some depth and nuance.

If you find my explanations too simple or too complex, please let me know and I can adjust my skill level accordingly.
