**Exercise: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**

Create a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. The game should:

1. Ask the user for their choice (rock, paper, or scissors)
2. Generate a random choice for the computer
3. Determine the winner based on the game's rules:
   - Rock beats scissors
   - Scissors beats paper
   - Paper beats rock
4. Display the result of the game

**Example Use Case:**

```
User: rock
Computer: scissors
Result: User wins!
```

**Your Task:**

Write the Python code to implement this game.

**Hint:** You can use the `random` module to generate a random choice for the computer.

**Get started!**

```python
import random

# Define the choices
choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']

# Get the user's choice
user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ")

# Generate a random choice for the computer
computer_choice = random.choice(choices)

# Determine the winner
if user_choice == computer_choice:
    result = "It's a tie!"
elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
     (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \
     (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):
    result = "User wins!"
else:
    result = "Computer wins!"

# Display the result
print(f"User: {user_choice}")
print(f"Computer: {computer_choice}")
print(result)
```

**Your Turn!**

Try to complete the code and run it. Then, modify it to add more features, such as asking the user if they want to play again.

**Exercise: Guessing Game**
==========================

Here's a simple guessing game to get you started:

**Objective:**
Guess a number between 1 and 100, and try to guess it in as few attempts as possible.

**Game Rules:**

1. The game will think of a number between 1 and 100.
2. You'll make a guess, and the game will tell you if you're closer to the number or farther away.
3. Keep guessing until you get the number right.

**Here's a hint:**

You can use the following hints to guide your guesses:

* `hint("lower")`: The number is lower than your guess.
* `hint("higher")`: The number is higher than your guess.
* `hint("correct")`: You're absolutely right!

**Your Task:**

Write a Python program to play this game. You'll need to:

1. Think of a number between 1 and 100.
2. Ask the user for a guess.
3. Check if the guess is correct, and give hints if not.
4. Keep asking for guesses until the user gets it right.

**Here's a starting point:**

```python
import random

def guess_game():
    # Think of a number between 1 and 100
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)

    # Ask the user for a guess
    while True:
        guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 100: ")

        # Check if the guess is a number
        try:
            guess = int(guess)
        except ValueError:
            print("That's not a number!")
            continue

        # Check if the guess is correct
        if guess == number_to_guess:
            print("Congratulations, you're absolutely right!")
            break

        # Give hints
        if guess < number_to_guess:
            print("Hint: The number is higher than your guess.")
        else:
            print("Hint: The number is lower than your guess.")

guess_game()
```

**Your Turn:**

Try to write the game without looking at the hint, and then compare your code with the hint. Don't worry if you get stuck – you can always ask for hints or hints about hints!

**Tips:**

* Think about how you can use variables to store the number to guess and the user's guess.
* Use a loop to keep asking for guesses until the user gets it right.
* Use the `random` module to think of

INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
## Python Exercise: "Guessing Game"

### Description

Create a simple number guessing game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game should continue until the user guesses the correct number.

### Requirements

- The game should generate a random number between 1 and 100.
- The user should be prompted to guess the number.
- The game should tell the user if their guess is higher or lower than the generated number.
- The game should continue until the user guesses the correct number.

### Example Use Case

```
Please guess a number between 1 and 100: 
Is your guess higher or lower than 50? 
Please guess a number between 1 and 100: 
Is your guess higher or lower than 75? 
Please guess a number between 1 and 100: 
 Congratulations! You guessed the number 75.

### Code

```python
import random

def guessing_game():
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)

    # Initialize a variable to store the user's guess
    user_guess = None

    while user_guess != number_to_guess:
        # Prompt the user to guess the number
        user_guess = int(input("Please guess a number between 1 and 100: ")

        # Check if the user's guess is higher or lower than the generated number
        if user_guess < number_to_guess:
            print("Is your guess higher or lower than", user_guess, "?")
        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:
            print("Is your guess higher or lower than", user_guess, "?")

    # Print a success message when the user guesses the correct number
    print("Congratulations! You guessed the number", number_to_guess)

# Call the function to start the game
guessing_game()

```

### Task

Complete the code by adding the missing `)` at the end of the `input` function call and the `elif` statement. Also, add a `print` statement to print the prompt for the initial guess.

### Hint

The `input` function in Python requires a closing parenthesis to complete the function call. The `elif` statement is used to check if the user's guess is higher or lower than the generated number.

### Expected Output

The game should continue to prompt the user to guess the number until they guess the correct number. The game should then print a success message with the correct number.

EXPERT-STEERED:
**Exercise: Hangman Game**
=========================

**Objective:**
Create a simple Hangman game using Python. The game will randomly select a word from a list, and the user will have to guess the word by suggesting letters. The user will have a limited number of attempts (6 in this case). The game will display the word with underscores representing the unknown letters, and the user's score will be displayed at the end.

**Code:**
```python
import random

# List of words to choose from
words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]

def hangman():
    # Select a random word from the list
    word = random.choice(words)
    word_length = len(word)
    display = ["_"] * word_length
    score = 6
    guessed = False
    guessed_word = []
    guessed_letters = []

    while score > 0 and not guessed:
        print(f"Score: {score}")
        print(" ".join(display))
        print("Guessed letters: ", " ".join(guessed_letters))
        letter = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()

        if len(letter) != 1:
            print("Please enter a single letter.")
            continue
        if letter in guessed_letters:
            print("You've already guessed this letter.")
            continue
        guessed_letters.append(letter)
        if letter in word:
            for i in range(word_length):
                if word[i] == letter:
                    display[i] = letter
            if "_" not in display:
                guessed = True
                print("Congratulations! You won!")
        else:
            score -= 1
            print(f"Score: {score}")
            print("Incorrect! The letter is not in the word.")
        if score == 0:
            print("Game over! The word was: " + word)
            print("Thanks for playing!")
    if score > 0:
        print("Thanks for playing!")

hangman()
```
**Instructions:**

1. Run the code.
2. The game will display the word with underscores representing the unknown letters.
3. Enter a letter by typing it in.
4. The game will display the word with the guessed letter(s) in the correct position(s).
5. If the letter is not in the word, the score will decrease by 1.
6. If the score reaches 0, the game will end and display the word.
7. If the user guesses the word correctly

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
Here's a simple exercise to practice Python:

**Exercise:**

Write a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list.

**Example Input:**

`numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`

**Example Output:**

`Sum of even numbers: 30`

**Constraints:**

* The input list can contain both positive and negative numbers.
* The input list can be empty.
* The function should not modify the original list.

**Your Task:**

Write a Python function that meets these requirements and test it with the example input.

**Hint:**

You can use a for loop or the built-in `sum()` function with a generator expression to solve this problem.

Go ahead and give it a try!
