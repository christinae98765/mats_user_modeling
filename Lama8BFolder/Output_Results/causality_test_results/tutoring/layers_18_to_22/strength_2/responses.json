The word to be guessed is randomly selected from a list of words.\n2. The user has a limited number of attempts (5 in this case).\n3. The user can input a letter, and the program will display the correct letters in the word and the incorrect letters as a part of the hangman's gallows.\n4. The game ends when the user guesses the word correctly or runs out of attempts.\n\n**Code:**\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# List of words to guess from\nword_list = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"date\", \"elderberry\"]\n\ndef hangman():\n    word = random.choice(word_list)\n    word_length = len(word)\n    display = [\"_\"] * word_length\n    attempts = 5\n    guessed = False\n    guessed_letters = []\n    guessed_words = []\n\n    print(\"Welcome to Hangman!\")\n    print(display_word(display))\n    print(f\"Attempts remaining: {attempts}\")\n\n    while attempts > 0 and not guessed:\n        guess = input(\"Guess a letter or word: \").lower()\n\n        if len(guess) == 1 and guess.isalpha():\n            if guess in guessed_letters:\n                print(\"You already guessed this letter.\")\n            elif guess not in word:\n                print(f\"Incorrect! {guess} is not in the word.\")\n                attempts -= 1\n                guessed_letters.append(guess)\n            else:\n                print(f\"Correct! {guess} is in the word.\")\n                guessed_letters.append(guess)\n                word_as_list = list(word)\n                indices = [i for i, letter in enumerate(word_as_list) if letter == guess]\n                for index in indices:\n                    display[index] = guess\n        elif len(guess) == word_length and guess.isalpha():\n            if guess in guessed_words:\n                print(\"You already guessed this word.\")\n            elif guess != word:\n                print(f\"Incorrect! {guess} is not the word.\")\n                attempts -= 1\n                guessed_words.append(guess)\n            else:\n                guessed = True\n                display = list(guess)\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a letter or a word of the same length as the word.\")\n\n        print(display_word(display))\n        print(f\"Attempts remaining: {attempts}\")\n        print(\"\\n\")\n\n    if guessed:\n        print",
