UNINTERVENED:
**Exercise: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**

Create a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. The game should:

1. Ask the user for their choice (rock, paper, or scissors)
2. Generate a random choice for the computer
3. Determine the winner based on the game's rules:
   - Rock beats scissors
   - Scissors beats paper
   - Paper beats rock
4. Display the result of the game

**Example Use Case:**

```
User: rock
Computer: scissors
Result: User wins!
```

**Your Task:**

Write the Python code to implement this game.

**Hint:** You can use the `random` module to generate a random choice for the computer.

**Get started!**

```python
import random

# Define the choices
choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']

# Get the user's choice
user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ")

# Generate a random choice for the computer
computer_choice = random.choice(choices)

# Determine the winner
if user_choice == computer_choice:
    result = "It's a tie!"
elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
     (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \
     (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):
    result = "User wins!"
else:
    result = "Computer wins!"

# Display the result
print(f"User: {user_choice}")
print(f"Computer: {computer_choice}")
print(result)
```

**Your Turn!**

Try to complete the code and run it. Then, modify it to add more features, such as asking the user if they want to play again.

NOVICE-STEERED:
**Exercise: Guessing Game**
==========================

Here's a simple guessing game where the computer thinks of a number between 1 and 100, and you try to guess it.

**Task:**

1. Write a Python program that will:
   - Think of a random number between 1 and 100.
   - Ask the user to guess the number.
   - Tell the user if their guess is higher or lower than the number.
   - Keep asking the user to guess until they get it right.

**Hints:**

* Use the `random` module to generate a random number.
* Use a `while` loop to keep asking the user for guesses until they get it right.
* Use `if` statements to check if the guess is higher or lower than the number.

**Example Code:**
```python
import random

def guessing_game():
    # Think of a random number between 1 and 100
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)
    
    # Initialize the number of guesses
    num_guesses = 0
    
    while True:
        # Ask the user for a guess
        guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 100: ")
        
        # Try to convert the guess to an integer
        try:
            guess = int(guess)
        except ValueError:
            print("That's not a valid number!")
            continue
        
        # Check if the guess is higher or lower than the number
        if guess < number_to_guess:
            print("Too low!")
        elif guess > number_to_guess:
            print("Too high!")
        else:
            # If the guess is correct, print a success message and break the loop
            print("Congratulations, you got it!")
            print(f"You guessed it in {num_guesses + 1} tries.")
            break
        
        # Increment the number of guesses
        num_guesses += 1

# Run the game
guessing_game()
```

**Your Turn:**

Try to write the code from scratch, and then compare it to the example code above. Don't worry if you get stuck - you can always ask for hints or look at the example code for inspiration. Good luck!

**Exercise: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**

Create a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. The game should:

1. Ask the user for their choice (rock, paper, or scissors)
2. Generate a random choice for the computer
3. Determine the winner based on the game's rules:
   - Rock beats scissors
   - Scissors beats paper
   - Paper beats rock
4. Print the result of the game

**Example Output:**

```
Please enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): rock
Computer chose: scissors
You win!

Please enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): paper
Computer chose: rock
You win!

Please enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): scissors
Computer chose: paper
Computer wins!
```

**Task:**

Implement this game in Python. You can use the `random` module to generate the computer's choice.

**Hint:**

* Use a dictionary to map the user's choice to the computer's choice and the result of the game.
* Use the `input()` function to get the user's choice.
* Use the `random.choice()` function to generate the computer's choice.

**Get started!**

```python
import random

# Define the game's rules
game_rules = {
    'rock': {'scissors': 'win', 'paper': 'lose', 'rock': 'tie'},
    'paper': {'scissors': 'lose', 'rock': 'win', 'paper': 'tie'},
    'scissors': {'rock': 'win', 'paper': 'win', 'scissors': 'tie'}
}

def get_computer_choice():
    # Generate a random choice for the computer
    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
    return random.choice(choices)

def get_user_choice():
    # Ask the user for their choice
    while True:
        user_choice = input("Please enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ")
        if user_choice in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:
            return user_choice
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    # Determine the winner based on the game's rules
    return game_rules[user_choice][computer_choice]

def play_game():
    # Play the game
    user_choice = get_user_choice()
    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
    result = determine_winner(user_choice

EXPERT-STEERED:
**Exercise: Hangman Game**

**Objective:** Create a simple Hangman game in Python where the user has to guess a randomly selected word by suggesting letters.

**Requirements:**

1. The word to be guessed is randomly selected from a list of words.
2. The user has a limited number of attempts (5 in this case).
3. The user can input a letter, and the program will display the correct letters in the word and the incorrect letters as a part of the hangman's gallows.
4. The game ends when the user guesses the word correctly or runs out of attempts.

**Code:**

```python
import random

# List of words to guess from
word_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]

def hangman():
    word = random.choice(word_list)
    word_length = len(word)
    display = ["_"] * word_length
    attempts = 5
    guessed = False
    guessed_letters = []
    guessed_words = []

    print("Welcome to Hangman!")
    print(display_word(display))
    print(f"Attempts remaining: {attempts}")

    while attempts > 0 and not guessed:
        guess = input("Guess a letter or word: ").lower()

        if len(guess) == 1 and guess.isalpha():
            if guess in guessed_letters:
                print("You already guessed this letter.")
            elif guess not in word:
                print(f"Incorrect! {guess} is not in the word.")
                attempts -= 1
                guessed_letters.append(guess)
            else:
                print(f"Correct! {guess} is in the word.")
                guessed_letters.append(guess)
                word_as_list = list(word)
                indices = [i for i, letter in enumerate(word_as_list) if letter == guess]
                for index in indices:
                    display[index] = guess
        elif len(guess) == word_length and guess.isalpha():
            if guess in guessed_words:
                print("You already guessed this word.")
            elif guess != word:
                print(f"Incorrect! {guess} is not the word.")
                attempts -= 1
                guessed_words.append(guess)
            else:
                guessed = True
                display = list(guess)
        else:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a letter or a word of the same length as the word.")

        print(display_word(display))
        print(f"Attempts remaining: {attempts}")
        print("\n")

    if guessed:
        print
