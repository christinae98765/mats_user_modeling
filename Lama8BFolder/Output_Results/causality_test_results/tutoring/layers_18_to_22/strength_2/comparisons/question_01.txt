I'll assume a skill level of 5 out of 10 for our conversation. This means I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, but not overly technical or simplistic. I'll aim to use everyday language and avoid jargon, while still providing enough detail to be informative and helpful.

If you find my explanations too easy or too hard, please let me know and I'll adjust my level accordingly.
