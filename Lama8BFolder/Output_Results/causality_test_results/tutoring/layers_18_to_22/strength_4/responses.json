      "**Exercise: Number Guessing Game**\n================================\n\n**Objective:** Create a simple number guessing game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10.\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n1. The user is presented with a prompt to guess a number between 1 and 10.\n2. The user's input is validated to ensure it is a number between 1 and 10.\n3. The user's guess is compared to the randomly generated number.\n4. The user is given feedback on their guess (e.g., \"too high\" or \"too low\").\n5. The user has a maximum of 5 attempts to guess the number correctly.\n6. The game ends with a win or loss message.\n\n**Code:**\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 10\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 10)\n    attempts = 5\n\n    while attempts > 0:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Guess a number between 1 and 10: \")\n\n        # Validate the user's input\n        if not (1 <= int(user_guess) <= 10):\n            print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a number between 1 and 10.\")\n            continue\n\n        # Compare the user's guess to the number\n        if int(user_guess) == number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You won!\")\n            break\n        elif int(user_guess) < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        attempts -= 1\n        print(f\"Remaining attempts: {attempts}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Game over! The number was {number_to_guess}.\")\n\nnumber_guessing_game()\n```\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Copy the code into a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `number_guessing_game.py`).\n2. Run the code using `python number_guessing_game.py`.\n3. Follow the prompts and enjoy the game!\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Use the `random` module to generate a random number.\n* Use a `while` loop to iterate through the user's attempts.\n* Use `input()` to get the user's input.\n* Use `int()` to convert the user's input to an integer.\n* Use `if-elif-else` statements to provide feedback on the user's guess.\n* Use a `while` loop with"
