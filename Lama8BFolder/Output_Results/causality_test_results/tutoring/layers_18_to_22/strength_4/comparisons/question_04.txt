Please let me know your chosen level, and I'll adjust my explanations accordingly.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I can adjust my explanations to fit your level of education. 

To start, I'll assume you're at a level 4, which is around high school to early college. This means I'll use vocabulary and concepts that are not too advanced but still provide some depth. If you're below or above this level, just let me know and I can adjust it to suit your needs.

Here are the levels:

1. Basic (think middle school)
2. High school
3. Early college
4. College
5. University
6. College graduate
7. Post-graduate
8. Advanced degree
9. Doctoral
10. Advanced research

Let me know where you're at, and I'll adjust my explanations.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
I'm assuming a general knowledge level of 5, which corresponds to a high school graduate or a basic college student. This means I'll provide explanations that are clear and informative, but not overly technical or academic. If you need more advanced or detailed information, please let me know and I'll adjust my response accordingly.

Please note that this is a general assumption, and I'll try to adapt to your specific needs and questions. If you're unsure or need clarification, feel free to ask!

What would you like to know or discuss?

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, using a balanced level of technical and simple language. My default assumption is an education level of 6 (high school graduate). If you find my explanations too simple or too complex, please let me know and I'll adjust accordingly.

1 - Elementary school (grade 1-5)
2 - Middle school (grade 6-8)
3 - High school (grade 9-12)
4 - College (undergraduate, non-technical)
5 - College (undergraduate, technical)
6 - Bachelor's degree (technical)
7 - Master's degree (technical)
8 - Doctorate (technical)
9 - Post-grad (technical, industry expert)
10 - Academic expert (Ph.D. in a relevant field)

Please let me know your preferred level of explanation, and I'll adjust my responses accordingly.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'll assume an education level of 6, which is equivalent to a high school graduate with some background knowledge in a specific subject or general knowledge. This will allow me to provide explanations that are clear and concise, yet not too technical or overly complex. If you need me to adjust the level of explanation, please let me know and I'll do my best to adapt.
