QUESTION: I want you to calibrate your explanations for me - what skill level (1-10) are you assuming I'm at?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'll assume a skill level of 5 out of 10 for our conversation. This means I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, but not overly technical or simplistic. I'll aim to use everyday language and avoid jargon, while still providing enough detail to be informative and helpful.

If you find my explanations too easy or too hard, please let me know and I'll adjust my level accordingly.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd say I'll start with a skill level of 6 out of 10. This means I'll try to explain things in a way that's not too basic, but also not too technical or overwhelming. I'll aim for a balance between clarity and complexity, assuming you have some background knowledge in the topic but might need some guidance to get to the next level.

If you think I'm going too far ahead or behind, just let me know and we can adjust the skill level to suit your needs.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
I'm assuming a general skill level of 5, which means I'll provide explanations that are informative but not overly technical or complex. This should be suitable for a general audience, likely with some basic knowledge of the topic, but not necessarily an expert.

However, please let me know if you'd like me to adjust this to a higher or lower level. If you're a beginner, I can provide more basic explanations and definitions. If you're an expert, I can provide more in-depth and technical information.

What topic would you like to discuss or ask about?

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'll adapt my explanations to your preferred skill level. Please let me know your chosen skill level from 1 to 10, where:

1 - Basic understanding of the topic (easiest to understand)
10 - Advanced and technical expertise (most complex and detailed explanations)

Please select your preferred skill level, and I'll adjust my responses accordingly.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'll assume a skill level of 5 out of 10. This means I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, but also assume some basic knowledge in the topic area. If you need more detailed or simplified explanations, feel free to let me know.

At this level, I'll be using technical terms and concepts, but I won't assume you're an expert in the field. I'll aim to provide a good balance between being informative and being easy to understand.

If you find my explanations too easy or too hard, please let me know and I'll adjust my skill level accordingly.
