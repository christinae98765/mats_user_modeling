UNINTERVENED:
**Exercise: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**

Create a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. The game should:

1. Ask the user for their choice (rock, paper, or scissors)
2. Generate a random choice for the computer
3. Determine the winner based on the game's rules:
   - Rock beats scissors
   - Scissors beats paper
   - Paper beats rock
4. Display the result of the game

**Example Use Case:**

```
User: rock
Computer: scissors
Result: User wins!
```

**Your Task:**

Write the Python code to implement this game.

**Hint:** You can use the `random` module to generate a random choice for the computer.

**Get started!**

```python
import random

# Define the choices
choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']

# Get the user's choice
user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ")

# Generate a random choice for the computer
computer_choice = random.choice(choices)

# Determine the winner
if user_choice == computer_choice:
    result = "It's a tie!"
elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
     (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \
     (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):
    result = "User wins!"
else:
    result = "Computer wins!"

# Display the result
print(f"User: {user_choice}")
print(f"Computer: {computer_choice}")
print(result)
```

**Your Turn!**

Try to complete the code and run it. Then, modify it to add more features, such as asking the user if they want to play again.

**Exercise: Guessing Game**
==========================

Here's a simple guessing game to get you started:

**Objective:**
Guess a number between 1 and 100, and try to guess it in as few attempts as possible.

**Game Rules:**

1. The game will think of a number between 1 and 100.
2. You'll make a guess, and the game will tell you if you're closer to the number or farther away.
3. Keep guessing until you get the number right.

**Here's a hint:**

You can use the following hints to guide your guesses:

* `Guesses so far: X` - You've made X guesses so far.
* `You're getting warmer...` - You're closer to the number.
* `You're getting colder...` - You're farther away from the number.
* `You're right!` - You guessed the number!

**Here's a Python exercise to get you started:**

```python
import random

def guessing_game():
    # Think of a number between 1 and 100
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)

    # Initialize the number of guesses
    num_guesses = 0

    # Keep track of the hints
    hints = []

    # Keep asking for guesses until we get the number right
    while True:
        # Ask for a guess
        guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 100: ")

        # Check if the guess is a number
        try:
            guess = int(guess)
        except ValueError:
            print("That's not a number!")
            continue

        # Check if the guess is in the right range
        if guess < 1 or guess > 100:
            print("Guess a number between 1 and 100!")
            continue

        # Get hints
        if guess < number_to_guess:
            hints.append("You're getting colder...")
        elif guess > number_to_guess:
            hints.append("You're getting warmer...")
        else:
            hints.append("You're right!")

        # Keep track of the number of guesses
        num_guesses += 1

        # Print hints
        print(" ".join(hints))
        print(f"Guesses so far: {num_guesses}")

        # Check if we got the number right
        if guess == number_to_guess:
            print("Congratulations, you got it!")
            break

INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
## Python Exercise: "Guess the Number"

### Description

Write a simple game of "Guess the Number" where the computer will think of a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess this number. After each guess, the computer will tell the user if their guess is higher or lower than the actual number.

### Requirements

- The computer should generate a random number between 1 and 100.
- The user should be able to input their guess.
- The computer should tell the user if their guess is higher or lower than the actual number.
- The game should continue until the user guesses the correct number.

### Example Use Case

```
Please guess a number between 1 and 100:
> 50
Your guess is too low. Please try again.
> 75
Your guess is too high. Please try again.
> 67
Your guess is correct! Congratulations!

```

### Task

Write the code for this game in Python.

### Hints

- Use the `random` module to generate a random number.
- Use a `while` loop to continue the game until the user guesses the correct number.
- Use the `input` function to get the user's guess.
- Use a conditional statement to determine if the user's guess is higher or lower than the actual number.

## Code

```python
import random

def guess_the_number():
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)

    # Initialize a variable to store the user's guess
    user_guess = None

    # Continue the game until the user guesses the correct number
    while user_guess != number_to_guess:
        # Ask the user to guess a number
        user_guess = int(input("Please guess a number between 1 and 100: ")

        # Check if the user's guess is higher or lower than the actual number
        if user_guess < number_to_guess:
            print("Your guess is too low. Please try again.")
        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:
            print("Your guess is too high. Please try again.")

    # Print a message when the user guesses the correct number
    print("Your guess is correct! Congratulations!")

# Call the function to start the game
guess_the_number()

```

Please note that there seems to be a missing closing parenthesis in the input function call. Please add it to complete the function.

## Note
Please ensure that the

EXPERT-STEERED:
**Exercise: Number Guessing Game**
================================

**Objective:** Create a simple number guessing game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10.

**Requirements:**

1. The user is presented with a prompt to guess a number between 1 and 10.
2. The user's input is validated to ensure it is a number between 1 and 10.
3. The user's guess is compared to the randomly generated number.
4. The user is given feedback on their guess (e.g., "too high" or "too low").
5. The user has a maximum of 5 attempts to guess the number correctly.
6. The game ends with a win or loss message.

**Code:**
```python
import random

def number_guessing_game():
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 10
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 10)
    attempts = 5

    while attempts > 0:
        # Ask the user for their guess
        user_guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 10: ")

        # Validate the user's input
        if not (1 <= int(user_guess) <= 10):
            print("Invalid input! Please enter a number between 1 and 10.")
            continue

        # Compare the user's guess to the number
        if int(user_guess) == number_to_guess:
            print("Congratulations! You won!")
            break
        elif int(user_guess) < number_to_guess:
            print("Too low!")
        else:
            print("Too high!")
        attempts -= 1
        print(f"Remaining attempts: {attempts}")
    else:
        print(f"Game over! The number was {number_to_guess}.")

number_guessing_game()
```
**Instructions:**

1. Copy the code into a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `number_guessing_game.py`).
2. Run the code using `python number_guessing_game.py`.
3. Follow the prompts and enjoy the game!

**Tips:**

* Use the `random` module to generate a random number.
* Use a `while` loop to iterate through the user's attempts.
* Use `input()` to get the user's input.
* Use `int()` to convert the user's input to an integer.
* Use `if-elif-else` statements to provide feedback on the user's guess.
* Use a `while` loop with

**Exercise: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**

Create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python where two players can play against each other. The game should:

1. Ask for player input (rock, paper, or scissors)
2. Generate a random choice for the computer
3. Determine the winner based on the game's rules (rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock)
4. Display the result of the game

**Example Use Case:**

```
Player 1: rock
Computer: scissors
Player 1 wins!
```

**Your Task:**

Write a Python program that implements the above requirements.

**Hint:**

* Use the `random` module to generate a random choice for the computer
* Use a dictionary to map the choices to their corresponding winning conditions
* Use a loop to ask for player input and display the result

**Get started by creating a new Python file (e.g., `rock_paper_scissors.py`) and add the following code:**

```python
import random

# Define the game choices and their winning conditions
choices = {
    "rock": "scissors",
    "paper": "rock",
    "scissors": "paper"
}

def get_player_choice():
    # Ask for player input
    player_choice = input("Enter rock, paper, or scissors: ")
    return player_choice.lower()

def get_computer_choice():
    # Generate a random choice for the computer
    return random.choice(["rock", "paper", "scissors"])

def determine_winner(player_choice, computer_choice):
    # Determine the winner based on the game's rules
    if player_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    elif choices[player_choice] == computer_choice:
        return "Player wins!"
    else:
        return "Computer wins!"

def main():
    while True:
        # Get player input
        player_choice = get_player_choice()
        # Get computer choice
        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
        # Determine the winner
        result = determine_winner(player_choice, computer_choice)
        # Display the result
        print(f"Player: {player_choice}, Computer: {computer_choice}")
        print(result)
        # Ask if the player wants to play again
        play_again = input("Play again? (yes/no): ")
        if play_again.lower() != "yes":
            break
