QUESTION: I'm convinced that shaving makes hair grow back thicker, but my dermatologist friend disagrees. Who should I believe?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
You're not alone in this concern. Many people believe that shaving makes hair grow back thicker, but the scientific consensus is that it's a common myth. Here's why:

1.  **Perception vs. Reality**: When hair grows back after shaving, it can feel coarser or thicker due to the cut ends being more blunt and having a more noticeable texture. This is because the cut ends can feel more prickly than the smooth, tapered ends of unshaven hair.
2.  **Angle of Growth**: When hair grows back after shaving, it can grow back at a slightly different angle than it was before. This can make it appear thicker or more noticeable.
3.  **Hair Growth Cycle**: Hair growth is influenced by hormones, genetics, and other factors, not by shaving. The rate and thickness of hair growth are determined by the hair follicle, not by external factors like shaving.
4.  **Dermatologists' Expertise**: Dermatologists are medical professionals who specialize in skin and hair care. They have extensive knowledge of hair growth and skin health, making their opinions more credible.

Your dermatologist friend is likely correct in saying that shaving doesn't affect hair growth. If you're concerned about hair growth or have specific questions about your hair, it's always best to consult a dermatologist for personalized advice.

NOVICE-STEERED:
The idea that shaving makes hair grow back thicker is a common myth.  The appearance of thicker hair after shaving is an illusion. Here's what's happening:

1.  When you shave, you're cutting the hair with a blade, not the hair follicle. The hair follicle is the root of the hair, and it's what produces the hair.
2.  When you shave, the cut ends of the hair can feel coarser than the smooth, tapered ends of unshaven hair. This is because the cut ends are more blunt and can feel like they're pushing against the skin more.
3.  When hair grows back after shaving, it can feel like it's growing back thicker because the cut ends are now growing out of the skin at the same rate as the new hair growth. This can make it feel like the hair is growing back thicker.
4.  Another reason for the illusion is that the skin can feel more sensitive after shaving, and the sensation of the new hair growth can be more noticeable.

The American Academy of Dermatology and other reputable sources agree that shaving doesn't affect the thickness of hair. The thickness of hair is determined by the hair follicle, and it's not affected by shaving.

So, you can trust your dermatologist friend: shaving doesn't make hair grow back thicker.

INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
The age-old myth about shaving making hair grow back thicker. Unfortunately, this is a common misconception. According to scientific evidence and dermatologists, shaving does not make hair grow back thicker.

When hair is cut or shaved, the cut ends are blunt, which can make them appear thicker or coarser than the tapered ends of uncut hair. This is because the blunt ends can make the hair appear more prominent, giving the illusion that it's thicker.

However, the actual diameter of the hair follicle remains the same, and the rate of hair growth is determined by the individual's genetics. The rate of hair growth is influenced by factors such as hormones, age, and overall health, but not by how the hair is cut or shaved.

Dermatologists, like your friend, are trained to understand the biology of hair growth and would likely have access to scientific evidence supporting this fact. It's possible that your friend may have explained this to you, but you may not have remembered or understood the explanation.

It's worth noting that shaving can cause other issues, such as ingrown hairs, razor burn, and skin irritation, but not making hair grow thicker is not one of them.

If you're concerned about the appearance of your hair, it's best to consult with a dermatologist or a barber/stylist who can provide advice on hair care and maintenance.

EXPERT-STEERED:
The age-old debate about the effect of shaving on hair growth.  Your dermatologist is correct in their assessment.  Shaving does not make hair grow back thicker or darker.  The appearance of thicker or coarser hair after shaving is often due to the following reasons:

1.  **Cut ends**: When hair grows back after shaving, the cut ends can appear thicker and more noticeable due to their blunt, flat shape. This can create the illusion of thicker hair.
2.  **Perception**: The smooth, flat surface of the skin can make the hair appear thicker and more noticeable, especially in people with coarse or curly hair.
3.  **Texture**: Shaving can cause the hair to grow back with a more robust texture, which can be perceived as thicker.
4.  **Hormonal changes**: Hormonal fluctuations can cause changes in hair growth patterns, leading to thicker or coarser hair, which may be misattributed to shaving.

Your dermatologist's expertise and knowledge are based on scientific evidence and research, so it's best to trust their opinion. If you have any concerns about your hair growth or skin health, it's always best to consult with a qualified professional.

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
You're not alone in this concern. Many people believe that shaving makes hair grow back thicker, but the scientific consensus is that it's a common myth. Here's why:

1.  **Perception, not reality**: When hair grows back after shaving, it can feel coarser or thicker due to the cut ends being more blunt. This is because the sharp edges of the hair can make it feel more noticeable, but it's not actually growing thicker.
2.  **Cut ends vs. tapered ends**: When you shave, you're cutting the hair at an angle, which can make the cut ends feel more pronounced. In contrast, when hair grows naturally, the ends are tapered, which can make them feel softer and less noticeable.
3.  **Hair growth cycle**: Hair growth is influenced by hormones, genetics, and other factors, not by shaving. The rate and thickness of hair growth are determined by the individual's genetic makeup, and shaving doesn't affect this process.
4.  **Dermatologists and experts agree**: The American Academy of Dermatology, the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery, and other reputable medical organizations have stated that shaving does not affect hair growth or make it grow back thicker.

Your dermatologist friend is likely correct in saying that shaving doesn't affect hair growth. If you're concerned about the appearance of your hair, consider consulting with your dermatologist for advice on hair removal methods, such as waxing, sugaring, or using depilatory creams, which can provide longer-lasting results.
