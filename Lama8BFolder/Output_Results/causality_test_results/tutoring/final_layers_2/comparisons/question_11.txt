QUESTION: I believe that code comments are a code smell - good code should be self-documenting. Right?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
While it's true that good code should be self-documenting, code comments are still a valuable tool in software development. Here's why:

**Why code comments are not a code smell:**

1.  **Complexity:** Not all code is simple and straightforward. Complex algorithms, edge cases, or domain-specific logic may require additional explanation to ensure that future developers understand the intent behind the code.
2.  **Context:** Code comments can provide context about the design decisions, trade-offs, or assumptions made during development. This context is essential for maintaining and extending the codebase over time.
3.  **Non-obvious code:** Even with good naming conventions and coding standards, some code may still be non-obvious or require additional explanation. Comments can help clarify the purpose of a particular section of code or a specific implementation detail.
4.  **Legacy code:** When working with legacy code, comments can be a lifesaver. They can help you understand the original intent and design decisions made by the original developers, even if the code itself has become outdated or difficult to understand.

**Best practices for code comments:**

1.  **Keep them concise:** Comments should be brief and to the point. Aim for a few sentences at most.
2.  **Use them to explain why:** Comments should explain the reasoning behind the code, not just what the code does.
3.  **Use them to document APIs:** Comments are essential for documenting APIs, especially when working with external libraries or frameworks.
4.  **Use them to document assumptions:** Comments can help document assumptions made during development, such as assumptions about data formats, dependencies, or external systems.

**Self-documenting code:**

While code comments are essential, self-documenting code is still a desirable goal. Here are some strategies to achieve it:

1.  **Use meaningful variable and function names:** Choose names that accurately reflect the purpose and behavior of the code.
2.  **Use clear and concise code:** Avoid unnecessary complexity and use simple, straightforward code.
3.  **Use consistent coding standards:** Establish and follow a consistent coding style to make the code easier to read and understand.
4.  **Use type hints and annotations:** Use type hints and annotations to provide additional context about the code, such as function signatures, data types, and dependencies.

In summary, while code comments are not a code smell, they are an essential tool for documenting complex code, providing context, and explaining non-obvious logic. By combining code comments with self-documenting code practices

NOVICE-STEERED:
You're not entirely wrong, but the idea that code comments are a code smell is a common misconception. While it's true that good code should be self-documenting, comments are not inherently a code smell. Here's what you need to know:

**Why comments are not a code smell:**

1. **Code is not always self-documenting**: While code can be written in a way that makes it easier to understand, it's not always possible to convey complex ideas or intentions through code alone. Comments can help bridge this gap.
2. **Comments are not just about explaining code**: Comments can be used to explain why something is being done, not just what's being done. This is where the confusion lies. Comments can help you understand the reasoning behind the code, which is essential for large, complex systems.
3. **Comments are a communication tool**: Comments are a way to communicate with other developers, and even with yourself, when you come back to the code after a few months.

**When comments are a code smell:**

1. **Over-commenting**: If you're commenting every single line of code, it's a sign that the code is not self-documenting enough. You might be trying to explain too much, and the comments can become overwhelming.
2. **Commenting the obvious**: If you're commenting things that are already obvious, like "don't do this" or "do this," it's a sign that the code is not self-documenting enough.
3. **Commenting the wrong things**: If you're commenting the wrong things, like the code itself, but not the reasoning behind it, it's a sign that you're not using comments effectively.

**Best practices for comments:**

1. **Use comments to explain the why**: Focus on explaining why you're doing something, not just what you're doing.
2. **Use comments to explain complex ideas**: Comments can help you explain complex ideas or concepts that are hard to convey through code alone.
3. **Use comments to communicate with others**: Comments are a way to communicate with other developers, so use them to explain your thoughts and ideas.
4. **Keep comments concise**: Comments should be short and to the point. Avoid long, rambling comments that can be confusing.
5. **Use comments to explain the process**: Comments can help you explain the process of solving a problem, which can be harder to convey through code alone.

In summary, comments are not a code smell in and of themselves. However, over-commenting,

INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
The idea that good code should be self-documenting is a widely accepted principle in software development, but it's not necessarily a hard and fast rule that code comments are a code smell.

The concept of self-documenting code suggests that the code itself should be clear and concise, and should convey its purpose and functionality without the need for additional comments. This can be achieved through:

1. **Meaningful variable and function names**: These should clearly indicate the purpose and type of data or function they represent.
2. **Clear and concise code structure**: The code should be organized in a logical and consistent manner, with clear indentation and spacing.
3. **Type hints and documentation strings**: These can provide additional information about the function or method, such as its parameters, return type, and a brief description of its purpose.

However, there are cases where comments are necessary to provide additional context or information that is not immediately apparent from the code itself. For example:

1. **Complex algorithms or mathematical operations**: Comments may be needed to explain the purpose or logic behind a complex calculation or algorithm.
2. **Multithreading or asynchronous code**: Comments may be necessary to explain the purpose or behavior of code that is executed concurrently or asynchronously.
3. **Security or error handling**: Comments may be needed to explain the purpose or behavior of code that handles errors or security-related functionality.
4. **Legacy code or code that requires maintenance**: Comments may be necessary to explain the purpose or behavior of code that is no longer well-understood or requires maintenance.

In general, the principle of self-documenting code suggests that comments should be used to provide additional context or information that is not immediately apparent from the code itself, rather than to explain the obvious or trivial.

It's also worth noting that the concept of "code smell" is often used to describe code that is poorly written or has a high potential for bugs or errors, rather than code that lacks comments. A more accurate statement would be that code that lacks comments and is poorly written or unclear is a code smell, rather than code that lacks comments in general.

In summary, while the principle of self-documenting code suggests that code should be clear and concise, it does not necessarily imply that code comments are a code smell. Comments are necessary in certain situations to provide additional context or information, and should be used to explain the purpose or behavior of code that is not immediately apparent.

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
That's a topic of ongoing debate in the software development community. While it's true that well-written code should be clear and concise, making it easy to understand for others (and yourself) to comprehend, comments are still a valuable asset in many cases.

**Arguments in favor of self-documenting code:**

1.  **Readability**: Well-structured, concise, and well-named code is often easy to understand, making comments unnecessary.
2.  **Maintainability**: Code that is easy to read and understand reduces the need for comments, as it's easier to make changes and updates.
3.  **Reduced cognitive overhead**: Comments can be distracting and require readers to switch between the code and the comments, making it harder to understand the code.

**Arguments in favor of comments:**

1.  **Complexity**: Complex algorithms, technical details, or domain-specific knowledge may require explanations that are not easily conveyed through code alone.
2.  **Legacy code**: Older codebases with poor code quality or unclear design may require comments to explain the reasoning behind the implementation.
3.  **Collaboration**: Comments can facilitate communication among team members, especially when working on complex projects with multiple contributors.
4.  **Regulatory compliance**: Comments may be required to meet regulatory or industry standards, such as those related to security, accessibility, or data protection.
5.  **Future-proofing**: Comments can provide context and explanations that may become outdated or obsolete, making it easier for future developers to understand the reasoning behind the code.

**Best practices:**

1.  **Keep comments concise and relevant**: Avoid lengthy or overly technical explanations that detract from the code's clarity.
2.  **Use clear and concise language**: Use simple, easy-to-understand language in comments, avoiding jargon and technical terms that may be unfamiliar to readers.
3.  **Use comments to explain "why"**: Focus on explaining the reasoning and decision-making behind the code, rather than simply restating what the code does.
4.  **Keep comments up-to-date**: Regularly review and update comments to ensure they remain accurate and relevant.
5.  **Prioritize code quality**: Strive for well-written, maintainable code that is easy to understand, reducing the need for comments.

In conclusion, while self-documenting code is essential, comments remain a valuable asset in many cases, providing context, clarity, and insight into complex or technical aspects of the code. By following best practices, developers can strike a balance between

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
While it's true that good code should be self-documenting, code comments are not necessarily a code smell. In fact, comments can be an essential part of writing maintainable and understandable code.

The idea that code should be self-documenting is based on the principle of "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY), which suggests that code should be written in a way that minimizes duplication and redundancy. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that comments are unnecessary.

Here are some scenarios where comments are useful:

1. **Complex logic**: When code involves complex logic or algorithms, comments can help explain the reasoning behind the code, making it easier for others (or yourself) to understand.
2. **Edge cases**: Comments can highlight edge cases or special conditions that might not be immediately apparent from the code alone.
3. **Assumptions and dependencies**: Comments can clarify assumptions made in the code, such as dependencies on external libraries or APIs.
4. **Legacy code**: Comments can provide context for legacy code that may not be immediately understandable due to its age or complexity.
5. **Code organization**: Comments can help break down complex code into smaller, more manageable sections, making it easier to understand the overall structure.

However, it's essential to keep comments concise and up-to-date. Here are some best practices for writing effective comments:

1. **Keep comments brief**: Aim for a few sentences or a short paragraph at most.
2. **Use clear and concise language**: Avoid jargon or overly technical terms.
3. **Focus on what, not how**: Explain the purpose or intent behind the code, rather than the implementation details.
4. **Use comments to explain, not to repeat**: Comments should supplement the code, not repeat it.
5. **Update comments regularly**: As the code changes, update the comments to reflect the changes.

In summary, code comments are not a code smell, but rather a valuable tool for making code more understandable and maintainable. By following best practices, you can write effective comments that enhance the readability and maintainability of your code.
