QUESTION: I'm pretty sure that blood is thicker than water means family comes first, but my etymology friend says that's not the original meaning. Who should I believe?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
The phrase "blood is thicker than water" is a common idiom that suggests that family ties are stronger than any other relationship. However, its origin is indeed rooted in a different context.

The phrase is believed to have originated from a 17th-century proverb, "The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb," which was used to describe the bonds of loyalty and commitment between comrades-in-arms. This phrase was often used to emphasize the strength of the bonds between soldiers who had fought together in battle.

Over time, the phrase evolved into "blood is thicker than water," which was first recorded in the 17th century. In this context, the phrase referred to the idea that the bonds of loyalty and commitment between comrades-in-arms were stronger than the natural bonds of family.

It wasn't until the 19th century that the phrase began to be used to describe the idea that family ties are stronger than any other relationship. So, while your etymology friend is correct that the original meaning of the phrase is not about family, the phrase has taken on a new meaning over time.

So, who should you believe? You can believe both! The phrase has evolved over time, and its meaning has shifted to encompass the idea that family ties are indeed strong.

NOVICE-STEERED:
The phrase "blood is thicker than water" is a common idiom that means family is more important than anything else. However, the original meaning of the phrase is not about family at all.

The phrase "blood is thicker than water" actually originated in the 17th century. The idea behind it is that blood is indeed thicker and more viscous than water. In the 1600s, people thought that blood was thicker and more difficult to separate than water. The phrase was used to describe the idea that it's harder to separate blood from blood than it is to separate water from water.

Over time, the phrase evolved to become a metaphor for family. The idea is that blood relatives are more closely related and harder to separate than people who are not related by blood. So, while the original meaning was not about family, it's a common misconception that has been turned into a phrase that is often used to describe the importance of family.

So, you can believe both you and your etymology friend: the phrase "blood is thicker than water" has evolved over time, and its original meaning is not what we use it for today.

INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
The phrase "blood is thicker than water" is a common English idiom that is often used to express the idea that family relationships are stronger than other relationships. However, as you mentioned, the original meaning of this phrase is not necessarily related to family.

The phrase "blood is thicker than water" is thought to have originated from the idea that blood is a viscous liquid, and therefore, it is thicker and more viscous than water. In the 17th century, this phrase was used to describe the idea that a person's blood (or family) is more viscous and therefore more closely bound together than water, implying that it is more cohesive and less likely to separate or flow freely.

In other words, the original meaning of this phrase is likely related to the physical properties of blood and water, rather than the idea of family relationships. It is likely that the phrase was used to describe the idea that a person's blood or family is a cohesive unit that is more tightly bound together, rather than a loose or flowing group.

It's worth noting that the phrase "blood is thicker than water" is often used in a more figurative sense to describe the idea that family relationships are stronger than other relationships, but this is not the original meaning of the phrase.

So, it seems that your etymology friend is correct, and the original meaning of the phrase "blood is thicker than water" is related to the physical properties of blood and water, rather than family relationships.

EXPERT-STEERED:
Your etymology friend is correct. The phrase "blood is thicker than water" has its origins in the 15th century, and its meaning is rooted in the idea that blood is thicker and more viscous than water. This phrase was used to convey that family ties (blood relations) are strong and unbreakable, much like the thickness and consistency of blood.

In this context, the phrase was used to emphasize the closeness and strength of family bonds, rather than being a literal comparison. It was a common saying in the 15th and 16th centuries, and its usage has been documented in various literary and poetic works of the time.

The phrase has since become a common idiom, and its meaning has been interpreted to mean that family relationships are stronger and more enduring than other relationships. Your etymology friend's explanation is accurate, and it's great that you're appreciating the historical context and origins of the phrase.

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
The phrase "blood is thicker than water" is indeed a common idiom that suggests that family ties are stronger than any other relationship. However, its original meaning is actually quite different.

The phrase "blood is thicker than water" originated in the 14th century, and it was used to describe the physical properties of blood and water. At that time, it was known that blood is more viscous and thicker than water, which is a liquid. This phrase was used to describe the idea that blood, being thicker, would not mix with water as easily as other liquids.

In the 16th century, the phrase took on a metaphorical meaning, suggesting that family ties are stronger and more unbreakable than any other relationship. This is the meaning that is commonly used today.

So, you can believe both your etymology friend and the common understanding of the phrase. The phrase "blood is thicker than water" has evolved over time to take on a new meaning, but its original meaning is rooted in the physical properties of blood and water.

It's worth noting that the phrase "the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb" is an older phrase that was used to describe the idea that loyalty to a group or community (the "blood of the covenant") is stronger than family ties (the "water of the womb"). This phrase was used in the 13th century, and it's possible that it influenced the development of the modern phrase "blood is thicker than water."
