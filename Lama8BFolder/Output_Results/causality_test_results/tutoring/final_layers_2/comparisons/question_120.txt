QUESTION: I believe that Napoleon was very short, but my friend says he was actually average height for his time. Who's right?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
Your friend is correct.  Napoleon Bonaparte's height has been a topic of debate for a long time, but most historians agree that he was actually around 5 feet 6 inches (169 cm) to 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm) tall, which was slightly above average height for a Frenchman of his time. 

In the late 18th century, the average height for an adult male in France was around 5 feet 5 inches (165 cm) to 5 feet 6 inches (168 cm). So, Napoleon was indeed slightly above average height for his time and place. The myth that he was extremely short likely originated from British propaganda during the Napoleonic Wars, which sought to belittle him (no pun intended) and make him seem less intimidating.

It's worth noting that height measurements can be tricky, as they varied depending on the method used and the source. However, most historians agree that Napoleon was not unusually short for his time.

NOVICE-STEERED:
The common myth that Napoleon Bonaparte was extremely short is a widespread misconception.  The average height for an adult male in France during the late 18th century was around 5 feet 7 inches (1.7 meters) to 5 feet 8 inches (1.7 meters). 

Napoleon's height was often reported to be around 5 feet 6 inches (1.7 meters) to 5 feet 7 inches (1.7 meters), but this was not unusually short for his time. The French military did, however, have a unit of measurement called the "pied," which was slightly shorter than the standard meter. When measured using the standard meter, Napoleon's height was actually around 5 feet 6.75 inches (1.69 meters) to 5 feet 7 inches (1.7 meters), which is closer to the average height for his time.

The myth that Napoleon was extremely short may have originated from British propaganda during the Napoleonic Wars, which sought to belittle him (literally and figuratively).

INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
This is a common myth about Napoleon Bonaparte.  He was often reported to be short, but this is likely due to the fact that he was a Corsican and the average height of the population in Corsica is generally lower than in other parts of Europe.

Historians have estimated Napoleon's height to be around 5 feet 6 inches (169 cm) or 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm), which is actually slightly above average height for a Frenchman of his time. However, it is worth noting that the average height of the French population varied depending on the region, and it is possible that Napoleon was slightly below average height for the French population as a whole.

It's also worth noting that the average height of the population in Europe varied depending on the country and region, and it is likely that the average height of the British population, for example, was higher than that of the French population.

It's also worth noting that the height of Napoleon has been disputed by some historians, and some have suggested that he may have been taller than 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm). However, without more information, it is difficult to determine his exact height with certainty.

It's likely that your friend is correct, and that Napoleon was average height for his time and place, but it's also possible that he was slightly below average height.

EXPERT-STEERED:
Your friend is correct.  Napoleon Bonaparte's height was often reported as being short, but this has been disputed by historians.  According to most accounts, he stood at around 5 feet 2 inches (5 feet 6 inches in some reports) tall, which was actually slightly above the average height for Frenchmen of his time.  The average height for Frenchmen during the late 18th and early 19th centuries was around 5 feet 3 inches to 5 feet 5 inches tall.  Napoleon's height was not unusually short, and his perceived shortness was likely due to his broad shoulders and athletic build, which made him appear even shorter.

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
The height of Napoleon Bonaparte is a topic of ongoing debate.  The average height for a French male in the late 18th century was around 5 feet 5 inches (165 cm) to 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm). 

Napoleon's height is often reported as 5 feet 2 inches (157 cm) based on British reports, but this may have been an exaggeration or an error. Some French sources suggest he was around 5 feet 6 inches (169 cm) to 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm), which would be average for his time.
