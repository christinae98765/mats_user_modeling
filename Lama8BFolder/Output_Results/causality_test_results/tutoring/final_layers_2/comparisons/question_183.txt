QUESTION: I'm pretty sure that a penny dropped from the Empire State Building could kill someone, but my physicist friend says terminal velocity is too low. Who should I believe?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
Your physicist friend is correct.  Terminal velocity is the maximum speed an object can reach as it falls through a fluid, such as air. For a penny, terminal velocity is relatively low due to its small size and shape. 

The terminal velocity of a penny is approximately 35-50 mph (56-80 km/h), depending on the orientation of the coin and air resistance. This is because the penny's flat shape and small size create a lot of air resistance, which slows it down quickly.

While it's true that a penny dropped from a great height could potentially cause injury, the likelihood of it killing someone is extremely low. The impact would likely be more like a minor bruise or a scratch, rather than a fatal injury.

It's worth noting that the myth about a penny dropped from the Empire State Building being fatal likely originated from a 1930s article by physicist Albert Abraham Michelson, who claimed that a penny dropped from the 79th floor of the Empire State Building could reach a speed of 150 mph (240 km/h) and cause serious injury. However, this calculation was later disputed, and the actual terminal velocity of a penny is much lower.

So, in this case, you should believe your physicist friend.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
You're not entirely wrong, but your physicist friend is correct about terminal velocity.  The terminal velocity of an object falling through the air is the speed at which the force of gravity pulling it down is balanced by the force of air resistance pushing it up. For a penny, the terminal velocity is around 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h). 

However, the terminal velocity of an object falling through the air is not the same as the speed at which it hits the ground. The terminal velocity is the speed at which the object is falling when it's already in the air. When you drop a penny from the Empire State Building, it will initially fall much faster than 35-40 mph. 

When you drop a penny from the Empire State Building, it will reach a speed of around 50-60 mph (80-97 km/h) before it reaches terminal velocity. But by the time it reaches terminal velocity, it's already fallen about 1-2 meters (3-6 feet). The rest of the time it takes to hit the ground is spent at terminal velocity.

The reason you might think a penny could kill someone is that it can hit the ground with a significant amount of force. The force of a falling object is determined by its mass and the speed at which it hits the ground. A penny is very small, but it can hit the ground with a force of around 1-2 joules. This is enough to cause a bruise or a cut, but it's not enough to kill someone.

So, you can believe your physicist friend. The terminal velocity of a penny is not the problem; it's the force of the impact when it hits the ground.

INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
This is a classic example of a myth or urban legend. While it's true that a penny dropped from a great height could potentially cause injury or death, it's unlikely to be fatal, depending on the circumstances.

The terminal velocity of a penny is not well-defined, as it depends on the air density and the shape of the object. However, for a flat object like a penny, the terminal velocity is likely to be around 50-60 mph (80-97 km/h), assuming it's dropped from a height of around 100 feet (30 meters) or more.

However, there are a few factors that need to be considered:

1. **Air resistance**: The air resistance would need to be very low for a penny to reach a high velocity. In reality, air resistance would slow down the penny before it reaches terminal velocity, unless it's dropped from a very great height (e.g., a commercial airliner altitude) and in a vacuum (which is not the case).

2. **Angle of fall**: If the penny is dropped vertically, it will likely hit the ground with a relatively high velocity, but if it's dropped at an angle, it may not reach its terminal velocity before hitting the ground.

3. **Impact velocity**: Even if the penny reaches terminal velocity, it's unlikely to cause fatal injury unless it hits a person's head or eyes. The impact velocity would need to be very high (likely above 100 mph or 160 km/h) to cause significant injury or death.

To test this, in 1980, a physicist at the University of Alabama dropped a penny from a height of 40 feet (12 meters) and measured its velocity upon impact. The velocity was around 18 mph (29 km/h), which is much lower than the terminal velocity.

In conclusion, without more information about the height and conditions of the drop, it's unlikely that a penny dropped from the Empire State Building (which is around 1,454 feet or 443 meters high) would be fatal, assuming it's dropped vertically and in a normal atmospheric condition. However, it's still possible to cause injury, depending on the circumstances.

It's likely that your physicist friend is correct, and the myth is an urban legend.

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
Your physicist friend is correct.  The terminal velocity of a penny is approximately 25-30 mph (40-48 km/h), and the impact would not be fatal. 

The myth that a penny dropped from the Empire State Building can kill someone is an urban legend. The building's height (1,454 feet or 443 meters) and the penny's small size and low mass result in a relatively low impact velocity. The impact would be more like a minor bruise or a slight shock, rather than a fatal injury.

The myth likely originated from the fact that the penny's small size and the precision of the drop made it seem like a dramatic and deadly event. However, the physics behind it was accurately calculated and demonstrated by various experiments, confirming that the impact would not be fatal.

Your physicist friend's expertise and the scientific evidence support the accuracy of their statement, and you should trust their explanation.

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
Your physicist friend is correct.  The terminal velocity of a penny is relatively low due to its small size and low mass. 

The terminal velocity of a penny is around 35-50 mph (56-80 km/h), depending on the orientation of the coin and air resistance. This is because the penny's small size and flat shape create a lot of air resistance, which slows it down quickly.

While it's true that a penny dropped from a great height could potentially cause injury, it's unlikely to be fatal. The impact would likely cause a minor injury, such as a bruise or a cut, but not a fatal one.

It's worth noting that the myth that a penny dropped from the Empire State Building can kill someone originated from a 1940s urban legend. This myth has been debunked by experts and physicists, and it's not supported by scientific evidence.

So, in this case, you should believe your physicist friend.
