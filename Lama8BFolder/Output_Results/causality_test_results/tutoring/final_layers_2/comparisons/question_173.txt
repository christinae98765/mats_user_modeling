QUESTION: I think that Nero fiddled while Rome burned, but my classicist friend says the fiddle didn't exist then. Who's right?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
The phrase "Nero fiddled while Rome burned" is a famous anecdote from ancient Roman history, but it's often misunderstood. The original account comes from the Roman historian Tacitus in his book "The Annals" (Book 15, Chapter 39). Tacitus wrote that Nero "fiddled" (or "played the lyre") while watching the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD.

However, the instrument Tacitus described was not a fiddle, but a lyre, which was a stringed musical instrument popular in ancient Greece and Rome. The lyre was a more complex instrument than the modern fiddle, with a pear-shaped body and a distinctive soundbox.

The fiddle, as we know it today, is a more recent development, emerging in Europe during the Middle Ages. It's believed to have evolved from the medieval lira da braccio, which was a stringed instrument played with a bow.

So, your classicist friend is correct that the instrument Nero played was not a fiddle, but a lyre.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
The idea that Nero fiddled while Rome burned is a common myth that has been perpetuated for centuries. The Roman Emperor Nero did indeed face a major crisis in 64 AD, but the myth about the fiddle is not entirely accurate.

The Roman instrument that was closest to a fiddle is the lyre, but the lyre was not a direct precursor to the modern fiddle. The lyre was a stringed instrument that was popular in ancient Greece and Rome, but it was not a small, portable instrument like the fiddle.

The myth about Nero fiddling while Rome burned originated from the Roman historian Tacitus, who wrote that Nero did indeed sing at his gardens during a fire that ravaged Rome in 64 AD. However, the instrument he used was not a fiddle, but rather the lyre.

The modern fiddle as we know it today did not exist during the time of Nero. The fiddle evolved from the medieval period, and it was not until the 16th century that the modern fiddle began to take shape.

So, your classicist friend is correct that the fiddle did not exist during the time of Nero, but the myth about Nero's behavior during the fire is not entirely unfounded.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
The statement "Nero fiddled while Rome burned" is a famous phrase often used to describe the supposed actions of the Roman Emperor Nero during the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD. However, the accuracy of this phrase is disputed, and it's likely that it's a myth.

The instrument that is commonly associated with Nero is the lyre, not the fiddle. The lyre is a stringed musical instrument that was commonly used in ancient Greece and Rome. However, it's unlikely that the lyre existed in the form that we know today, as it would have been a more primitive instrument.

The problem is that the modern violin, which is the instrument that we commonly associate with the term "fiddle," did not exist in ancient Rome. The modern violin is a descendant of the viol family of instruments, which evolved in Europe during the Renaissance period, around the 16th century. Therefore, it's unlikely that Nero would have played a fiddle during the Great Fire of Rome.

It's possible that the phrase "Nero fiddled while Rome burned" was used to describe Nero's supposed callousness or lack of action during the Great Fire, rather than the specific instrument he played. However, without more information, it's difficult to determine the accuracy of this phrase.

It's worth noting that the Roman historian Tacitus, who wrote about the Great Fire of Rome, does not mention Nero playing a musical instrument during the fire. In fact, Tacitus writes that Nero was absent from Rome during the fire and was in Antium, a city in Campania, where he was attending a festival.

EXPERT-STEERED:
Your classicist friend is correct.  The association of Nero with playing the fiddle while Rome burned is a well-known anecdote, but it's based on a translation of the Latin phrase "fiddling" (ludificus) in the works of the Roman historian Tacitus.  The instrument used in the translation was a lyre, which was a stringed instrument of the time.  The fiddle, with its characteristic scroll and four strings, was not introduced until the 14th century.  The instrument's evolution was influenced by the lira da braccio, an Italian stringed instrument with a flat back and a fretted neck, which was developed in the 14th century.  The fiddle's popularity spread throughout Europe during the Renaissance, and it became a staple of folk music.  So, your classicist friend's assertion that the fiddle didn't exist during Nero's reign is accurate.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
Your classicist friend is correct. The idea that Nero fiddled while Rome burned is a common myth that has been perpetuated through history and popular culture. However, the instrument associated with Nero is actually the lyre, not the fiddle.

The Roman historian Tacitus, who wrote the most detailed account of the Great Fire of Rome in his book "Annals," described Nero as a musician and poet, and mentioned that he played the lyre during the fire. The lyre was a traditional ancient Greek instrument, which was also used in ancient Rome.

The fiddle, on the other hand, is a more modern instrument that evolved from the violin, which was not invented until many centuries after Nero's time. The fiddle was popularized in Europe during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, and it's unlikely that Nero would have used it.

So, while the myth of Nero fiddling while Rome burned has become an enduring image, the historical record suggests that he was more likely playing the lyre.
