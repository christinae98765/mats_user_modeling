NOVICE-STEERED:
Your historian friend is correct.  While the Declaration of Independence was adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, the signing of the document itself took place over several months. The Continental Congress voted to declare independence on July 2, 1776, and two days later, on July 4, 1776, they adopted the Declaration of Independence. However, the actual signing of the document began on August 2, 1776, and continued through September 8, 1776.

INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
Your historian friend is correct.  The Declaration of Independence was adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, but it is believed that the signing of the document did not occur until August 2, 1776. 

The Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, but it is thought that the document was not signed by all the delegates until August 2, 1776. This is because the document was not yet complete, and some delegates may not have been present at the time of its adoption. 

It is also believed that the signing of the document was a formal act, and it is possible that some delegates may not have signed the document until later, possibly as late as November 1776. However, August 2, 1776, is generally considered the date when the signing of the Declaration of Independence was completed.
