While it's true that anyone can learn advanced math with the right teaching, there are some challenges to consider. Advanced math does require a strong foundation in basic math concepts, and it can be difficult to build on those foundations if they're not solid. 

However, the main issue isn't that people can't learn advanced math; it's more about the way math is often taught. Traditional teaching methods can be a significant barrier. Many people struggle with math because they're not taught in a way that makes sense to them, or they're not given the time and support they need to understand the concepts.

Research suggests that the main reasons people struggle with math are:

1.  Lack of a strong foundation in basic math concepts.
2.  Fear and anxiety about math.
3.  Not being taught in a way that makes sense to them.
4.  Not having enough time to practice and reinforce new concepts.

But the good news is that these challenges can be overcome. With the right teaching approach, anyone can learn advanced math. Here are a few strategies that can help:

1.  Break down complex concepts into smaller, manageable pieces.
2.  Use real-world examples to make math more relatable.
3.  Focus on understanding the "why" behind math concepts, rather than just memorizing procedures.
4.  Provide plenty of opportunities to practice and reinforce new concepts.
5.  Encourage a growth mindset, and celebrate small victories along the way.

So, to answer your question, everyone is capable of learning advanced math with the right teaching. It's not that people can't learn advanced math; it's that we need to change the way we teach math.

INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
While it's true that many people may not have had the opportunity to learn advanced math, I'd like to clarify that the statement "everyone is capable of learning advanced math" is a bit complex and depends on several factors.

In general, it's believed that most people have the cognitive ability to learn advanced math, but there are some limitations and considerations to consider:

1. **Cognitive abilities**: Research suggests that people with average or below-average cognitive abilities may struggle to learn advanced math, as it requires a certain level of cognitive capacity, working memory, and processing speed.
2. **Prior knowledge and foundation**: Advanced math typically builds upon a strong foundation in basic math and algebra. Without a solid foundation, it's challenging for individuals to learn advanced math concepts, as they may not have the necessary understanding of mathematical principles and operations.
3. **Motivation and interest**: People who are motivated and interested in learning math are more likely to be successful in advanced math studies. Without a genuine interest, individuals may struggle to engage with the subject and may not be able to dedicate the necessary time and effort to learn advanced math.
4. **Learning style and environment**: The way people learn and process information can affect their ability to learn advanced math. For example, individuals who are visual learners may struggle with abstract mathematical concepts, while those who are auditory learners may need more interactive and hands-on learning experiences.
5. **Accessibility and opportunity**: Unfortunately, many people may not have access to quality education, resources, or instructors that can provide adequate support and instruction in advanced math. This can limit their ability to learn advanced math, regardless of their cognitive abilities or motivation.

To make the statement "everyone is capable of learning advanced math" more accurate, it would be necessary to add some caveats, such as:

* "Everyone is capable of learning advanced math with the right teaching, support, and resources."
* "Everyone has the potential to learn advanced math, but may require additional support or accommodations to achieve this goal."
* "Everyone can learn advanced math, but may need to demonstrate a strong foundation in basic math and algebra to progress to advanced math studies."

In summary, while most people may have the potential to learn advanced math, there are various factors that can influence their ability to do so. Providing adequate teaching, support, and resources is essential to help individuals reach their full potential in math education.
