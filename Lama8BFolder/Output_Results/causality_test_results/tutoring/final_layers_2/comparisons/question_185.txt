QUESTION: I believe that daddy longlegs are the most venomous spiders but can't bite humans, but my friend says that's false on multiple counts. Who's correct?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
Your friend is correct.  The common myth that daddy long legs (also known as cellar spiders or pholcids) are the most venomous spiders but can't bite humans is false on both counts.

Firstly, daddy long legs are not typically venomous to humans. While they do have venom, it's not strong enough to cause significant harm to humans. Their venom is primarily used to immobilize small insects and other arachnids.

Secondly, daddy long legs are perfectly capable of biting humans if they feel threatened or cornered. However, their mouthparts are not adapted for piercing skin, and their fangs are too short and weak to penetrate human skin. Even if they were able to bite, the venom would likely not cause any significant harm.

It's worth noting that the myth about daddy long legs being venomous may have originated from a misunderstanding of the fact that they are related to the brown recluse spider (Loxosceles reclusa), which is venomous. However, the venom of the brown recluse spider is highly toxic and can cause necrotic lesions in humans, whereas the venom of daddy long legs is not.

So, while your friend is correct in debunking the myth, it's also worth noting that the myth may have originated from a grain of truth about the related brown recluse spider.

NOVICE-STEERED:
Your friend is correct.  The common myth that daddy long legs (also known as cellar spiders or harvestmen) are the most venomous spiders and can't bite humans is a mix-up of two separate facts. 

First, daddy long legs are not the most venomous spiders. The most venomous spiders are actually found in other families, such as the black widow and brown recluse spiders. 

Second, daddy long legs can bite humans, but they do not have fangs that can penetrate human skin. They have eight fangs, but these fangs are very small and not strong enough to break through human skin.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
Your friend is likely correct.  The daddy longlegs (also known as pholcus pholos or cellar spider) is a type of spider, but it is not venomous to humans. 

The venom of the daddy longlegs is not potent enough to cause harm to humans, and it is not known to be medically significant. However, it is not entirely clear if the daddy longlegs is capable of biting humans, as it is generally a non-aggressive spider and is not known to bite unless it is provoked.

The myth that daddy longlegs is the most venomous spider but cannot bite humans likely originated from a misunderstanding or a lack of information. It is possible that this myth is related to the fact that daddy longlegs is often found in dark, damp areas and is associated with other spiders that are venomous, such as the brown recluse or black widow spider.

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
Your friend is correct.  The daddy longlegs (also known as cellar spiders or pholcids) are not venomous to humans. Their venom is not potent enough to cause harm to humans, and they are not aggressive, making it unlikely for them to bite humans even if they do bite.

The myth that daddy longlegs are the most venomous spiders and that their venom is potent enough to kill with a single bite is an urban legend with no scientific basis. This myth likely originated from the combination of the spider's large fangs and the supposed potency of their venom, which is not supported by scientific evidence.

It's worth noting that the venom of daddy longlegs is primarily used to immobilize their insect prey, and it is not a significant threat to humans.

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
Your friend is correct.  The claim that daddy long legs (also known as cellar spiders or pholcids) are the most venomous spiders but can't bite humans is a common myth. 

Daddy long legs spiders do have venom, but it's not strong enough to cause significant harm to humans. However, the myth that they can't bite humans is also false. They can bite, but their venom is not potent enough to cause any serious harm to humans.

The myth likely originated from the fact that the venom of the daddy long legs spider is highly diluted, as they use their venom to immobilize their prey, which is usually small insects. The venom is not strong enough to penetrate human skin, but it's not impossible for them to bite.

It's worth noting that the myth may have originated from a misunderstanding of the fact that the venom of the brown recluse spider (Loxosceles spp.) is highly toxic, but the brown recluse spider is not a daddy long legs spider.
