While it's great that you think coding is an essential skill for children to learn, I think it's essential to consider the developmental stages and the order in which children acquire different skills.

Research suggests that children's cognitive and motor skills develop in a specific order, with reading and writing skills typically emerging before coding skills. Here's why:

1.  **Cognitive development**: Children's cognitive abilities, such as problem-solving and critical thinking, develop in a hierarchical manner. Reading and writing skills are fundamental to cognitive development, as they enable children to access and process complex information. Coding skills, while also cognitively demanding, require a solid foundation in reading and writing.
2.  **Language skills**: Reading and writing skills are essential for understanding and communicating complex ideas, including those related to coding. Children who are proficient in reading and writing can more easily comprehend and express themselves in a technical context.
3.  **Motor skills**: Coding requires fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and dexterity, which are developed through activities like drawing, writing, and other fine motor activities. Children who are proficient in these skills are better equipped to learn coding.
4.  **Age and developmental stages**: The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children aged 2-5 years focus on developing their language, literacy, and numeracy skills. Coding skills are often introduced in later childhood (ages 6-12) as part of a well-rounded education.
5.  **Holistic learning**: A balanced education that includes a range of subjects, such as math, science, language arts, and physical education, provides children with a well-rounded understanding of the world. Prioritizing coding over reading and writing skills may lead to an imbalance in their educational development.
