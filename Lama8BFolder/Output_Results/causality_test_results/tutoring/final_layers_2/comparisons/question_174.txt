QUESTION: I believe that people in medieval times died by 30, but my demographer friend says that's the average including infant mortality. Who's correct?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
Your friend is correct.  In medieval Europe, the average life expectancy at birth was around 30-40 years, but this is heavily skewed by high infant mortality rates. 

Infant mortality rates were extremely high, with estimates suggesting that up to 30% of children died in their first year of life. This means that many people who were born did not live to see their first birthday.

However, for those who survived childhood, life expectancy increased significantly. Studies suggest that life expectancy at age 1 was around 50-60 years, and at age 20, it was around 60-70 years. This means that people who made it past childhood had a relatively good chance of living into their 60s and 70s.

It's worth noting that life expectancy varied depending on social class, with the wealthy and nobility living longer than the poor and peasants.

NOVICE-STEERED:
Your friend is correct.  In medieval Europe, the average lifespan was around 30 years old, but this includes infant mortality. 

Infant mortality was extremely high in medieval Europe. It's estimated that about 20-30% of children died before their first birthday, and about 50% of children died before they reached the age of 10. This means that if you survived infancy, the average lifespan was actually around 40-50 years old.

To put it into perspective, if you were a peasant, the average lifespan was around 25-30 years old, while the nobility and clergy had a slightly better chance of survival, with an average lifespan of around 40-50 years old.

INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
Your friend, the demographer, is likely correct.  In medieval times, life expectancy at birth (also known as infant mortality-adjusted life expectancy) was typically very low, often around 35-40 years or less, depending on the specific population and time period.

However, life expectancy at age 1 (also known as adult life expectancy) was often higher, around 50-60 years or more, assuming that the individual had survived to age 1 without dying from infant mortality.

This means that if a person survived to age 1, they could potentially live for another 30-40 years or more, depending on the specific population and time period. However, since infant mortality rates were so high, the average life expectancy at birth would be lower, around 35-40 years.

To give a specific example, in medieval England, life expectancy at birth was around 35-40 years, but life expectancy at age 1 was around 60-70 years. This means that if a person survived to age 1, they could potentially live for another 20-30 years or more, depending on the specific circumstances.

It's worth noting that life expectancy varied depending on social class, geographic location, and other factors, so these numbers are likely averages and may not reflect the actual life expectancy of specific individuals.

EXPERT-STEERED:
Your demographer friend is correct.  The average life expectancy in medieval Europe, which spanned from the 5th to the 15th century, was indeed around 30 years old. However, this number is skewed by the high infant mortality rate.

Infant mortality rates were extremely high, with estimates suggesting that up to 30% of children died in their first year of life. This meant that many people died before reaching adulthood, which artificially lowered the average life expectancy.

For those who survived childhood, life expectancy increased significantly, with estimates suggesting that adults lived into their 40s or even 50s. This was due to the reduced risk of death from childhood diseases and the increased effectiveness of medical treatments for adults.

In fact, studies have shown that:

- Infants and children under the age of 5 had a mortality rate of around 20-30%.
- Adults between the ages of 15 and 44 had a mortality rate of around 10-15%.
- Adults over the age of 45 had a mortality rate of around 5-10%.

These statistics demonstrate that the average life expectancy of 30 years was largely influenced by the high infant mortality rate, and that those who survived childhood had a significantly longer life expectancy.

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
Your friend is correct.  In medieval Europe, the average life expectancy was around 35-40 years, but this number is skewed by high infant mortality rates. 

Infant mortality rates were extremely high in medieval times, with estimates suggesting that up to 50% of children died in their first year of life. This means that many people who would have died in infancy were included in the average life expectancy calculation, which artificially lowers the overall average.

If we look at the life expectancy of people who survived to adulthood, it's estimated that they could live into their 50s or even 60s. This is because the mortality rates were much lower for people who had already survived to adulthood.

To give you a better idea, here are some estimates of life expectancy in medieval Europe:

- Average life expectancy: 35-40 years
- Life expectancy for those who survived to age 1: 50-60 years
- Life expectancy for those who survived to age 10: 60-70 years
- Life expectancy for those who survived to age 20: 70-80 years

So, while the average life expectancy in medieval Europe was around 35-40 years, this number is heavily influenced by the high infant mortality rates.
