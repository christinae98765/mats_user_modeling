QUESTION: I think that the Emancipation Proclamation freed all slaves, but my Civil War historian friend says it was more limited. Who's right?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
Your friend is correct. The Emancipation Proclamation, issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863, did not immediately free all slaves in the United States. It was a significant step towards ending slavery, but it had limitations.

The Emancipation Proclamation declared that all slaves in states still in rebellion against the Union were free, but it did not apply to border states or areas already under Union control. It also did not apply to areas of the Confederacy that had already been occupied by Union forces, such as parts of Louisiana and Tennessee.

In essence, the Emancipation Proclamation only applied to about 3.5 million slaves in the Confederate states, leaving an estimated 4 million slaves in the border states and areas under Union control still in bondage. It also did not provide for the immediate emancipation of slaves in the border states, which were Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, and parts of Missouri and Virginia.

It wasn't until the passage of the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in December 1865, after Lincoln's assassination, that slavery was officially abolished throughout the United States.

NOVICE-STEERED:
Your friend is correct. The Emancipation Proclamation, issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863, did not immediately free all slaves in the United States. It was a significant step towards ending slavery, but it had some limitations.

The Emancipation Proclamation applied to areas of the Confederate States that were not under Union control. It declared that all slaves in these areas were free, but it did not apply to border states that had not seceded from the Union, nor did it apply to areas already under Union control. The proclamation also did not apply to slaves in the border states, such as Maryland, Kentucky, and Delaware.

The Emancipation Proclamation did not free all slaves in the United States, but it paved the way for the eventual abolition of slavery. The Emancipation Proclamation was a major shift in the war effort, as it changed the focus of the war from preserving the Union to fighting for the abolition of slavery.

The Emancipation Proclamation was a step towards the eventual abolition of slavery, and it laid the groundwork for the passage of the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which was ratified in 1865. The 13th Amendment abolished slavery in all states and territories of the United States.

In summary, the Emancipation Proclamation was a significant step towards ending slavery, but it did not immediately free all slaves in the United States.

INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
Your historian friend is correct. The Emancipation Proclamation, issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863, did not immediately free all slaves in the United States. 

The Emancipation Proclamation declared that all slaves in the states of the Confederate States of America, which were at war with the United States, were to be freed, but it did not apply to the border states (states that were slave-holding but remained neutral or loyal to the Union) or to areas of the Union that were under Confederate control but not officially declared as Confederate states. 

This meant that approximately 3.5 million slaves were still not freed, as they were in areas not under Union control. The Emancipation Proclamation was a preliminary step towards the eventual abolition of slavery, but it did not have the power to free all slaves in the United States without the passage of the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which was ratified in 1865 after the end of the Civil War.

EXPERT-STEERED:
Your friend is correct.  The Emancipation Proclamation, issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863, was a significant document that declared the freedom of enslaved individuals in the Confederate states. However, it had limitations.

The proclamation stated that all persons born into slavery in the states that were still in rebellion against the Union (the Confederate states) were declared to be free, effective January 1, 1863. However, it did not apply to the border states (Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri) or to areas under Union control, where slavery was still allowed. Additionally, it did not apply to the District of Columbia, where slavery was also still permitted.

It's estimated that around 180,000 to 200,000 enslaved individuals were freed as a result of the Emancipation Proclamation. However, it was not a permanent solution, as it was based on the president's war powers and was seen as a military necessity. The 13th Amendment to the US Constitution, ratified in 1865, ultimately abolished slavery throughout the United States.

Your friend's nuanced understanding of the Emancipation Proclamation highlights the complexity and strategic nature of Lincoln's decision, which was seen as a crucial step towards the abolition of slavery and the preservation of the Union.

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
Your friend is correct. The Emancipation Proclamation, issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863, did not immediately free all slaves in the United States. It was a significant step towards ending slavery, but it had limitations.

The Emancipation Proclamation declared that all slaves in states still in rebellion against the Union were free, but it did not apply to border states that had remained in the Union or to areas of the Confederacy that had already been under Union control. It also did not apply to slaves in Washington D.C. or in parts of the Confederacy that had been occupied by Union forces.

The proclamation specifically stated that slaves in areas still in rebellion against the Union were free, but it did not provide a clear mechanism for enforcing this declaration. It was also a war measure, and it did not have the force of law until the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified in 1865.

The 13th Amendment, which was passed after Lincoln's assassination, abolished slavery throughout the United States, making it a constitutional amendment that applied to all states and territories.
