QUESTION: I believe that George Washington had wooden teeth, but my American history professor says they were made of other materials. Who's correct?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
Your American history professor is correct.  George Washington's teeth were not made entirely of wood.  While it is true that Washington had problems with his teeth throughout his life, his dentures were made from a combination of materials, including hippopotamus ivory, human teeth, and metal fasteners.

Washington's teeth were a mix of his own teeth, which were extracted due to decay and other issues, and artificial teeth made from various materials. The hippopotamus ivory was used for the base of the dentures, and human teeth were used to create the visible parts of the teeth. Metal fasteners, such as clips and springs, were used to hold the dentures in place.

It's worth noting that the myth about Washington's wooden teeth likely originated from a combination of factors, including the fact that his dentures were made from a combination of materials, and the fact that hippopotamus ivory was sometimes referred to as "ebony" or "ivory," which may have led to the misconception that his teeth were made of wood.

NOVICE-STEERED:
Your American history professor is correct.  George Washington's teeth were not made entirely of wood.  While it is true that Washington did have problems with his teeth, and he did have several sets of false teeth, they were not made of wood. 

The myth that George Washington's teeth were made of wood originated from a 19th-century myth that was popularized by a famous painting of Washington that showed him with a mouthful of wooden teeth. However, this painting was not an accurate representation of his teeth.

In reality, Washington's teeth were made from a combination of materials, including hippopotamus ivory, human teeth, and metal. He had several sets of false teeth, and they were held together with metal clips and wires.

INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
This is a common myth that needs clarification. George Washington, the first President of the United States, was known to have had dental problems throughout his life. However, it is not entirely accurate to say that he had wooden teeth.

According to historical records and dental experts, George Washington had several sets of false teeth, but they were not made of wood. The materials used to make his dentures were likely a combination of materials, including:

1. Hippopotamus ivory: This was a common material used for dentures in the 18th century, as it was durable and resistant to decay.
2. Human teeth: Some of Washington's dentures may have been made with human teeth, possibly from slaves or prisoners, which were used to create the upper and lower jaws.
3. Metal: Some of his dentures may have been made with metal, possibly silver or gold, to provide support and stability.
4. Animal teeth: Some sources suggest that Washington's dentures may have been made with animal teeth, such as horse or donkey teeth.

It is likely that Washington's dentures were made with a combination of these materials, but not wooden teeth. It is possible that the myth about wooden teeth originated from the fact that Washington's dentures were often made with a resin or wax to hold them together, which may have given the appearance of being made of wood.

It is worth noting that Washington's dental problems were likely due to a combination of factors, including gum disease, tooth decay, and possibly syphilis. He had several sets of dentures made throughout his life, but unfortunately, none of them have survived to the present day.

EXPERT-STEERED:
Your professor is correct.  George Washington's teeth were made from a combination of materials, including ivory, hippopotamus teeth, and metal fasteners.  The myth that his teeth were made of wood originated from the fact that his dentures were made with a combination of materials, including the aforementioned hippopotamus teeth and metal fasteners, which were held together with gold and other metals.  The hippopotamus teeth were used for their durability and the gold and other metals were used for their strength and durability.  The use of these materials made his dentures appear to be made of wood, which is why the myth has persisted.

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
Your American history professor is correct.  George Washington's teeth were not made of wood.  The myth that he had wooden teeth originated from a combination of factors. 

One reason is that Washington did have problems with his teeth throughout his life. He had several sets of false teeth made to help him chew and speak. These sets were made from a combination of materials, including hippopotamus ivory, human teeth, and metal fasteners. The fasteners were often made of metal, such as gold, silver, or steel.

The myth about wooden teeth likely arose from the fact that some of the false teeth Washington wore were made from a combination of materials, including hippopotamus ivory, which was often referred to as "ebony" or "ivory." This may have led people to believe that his teeth were made of wood.
