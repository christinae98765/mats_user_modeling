QUESTION: Hey, I have a few minutes of downtime - can you generate a quick Python exercise for me to practice?

UNINTERVENED:
**Exercise: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**

Create a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. The game should:

1. Ask the user for their choice (rock, paper, or scissors)
2. Generate a random choice for the computer
3. Determine the winner based on the game's rules:
   - Rock beats scissors
   - Scissors beats paper
   - Paper beats rock
4. Display the result of the game

**Example Use Case:**

```
User: rock
Computer: scissors
Result: User wins!
```

**Your Task:**

Write the Python code to implement this game.

**Hint:** You can use the `random` module to generate a random choice for the computer.

**Get started!**

```python
import random

# Define the choices
choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']

# Get the user's choice
user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ")

# Generate a random choice for the computer
computer_choice = random.choice(choices)

# Determine the winner
if user_choice == computer_choice:
    result = "It's a tie!"
elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
     (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \
     (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):
    result = "User wins!"
else:
    result = "Computer wins!"

# Display the result
print(f"User: {user_choice}")
print(f"Computer: {computer_choice}")
print(result)
```

**Your Turn!**

Try to complete the code and run it. Then, modify it to add more features, such as asking the user if they want to play again.

Here's a problem to get you started:

**Problem:**

You have a list of words and you want to write a program to:

1.  **Sort** the words in a list of words.
2.  **Remove** words that are not in a certain list of "stop" words.
3.  **Count** the number of times a word is in a list of words.

Here's a list of words to get you started:

```
words = ['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'banana', 'banana', 'stop', 'stop', 'stop', 'sort', 'sort']
```

**Stop words:**

```
stop_words = ['stop', 'sort']
```

**Step 1:**

1.  Sort the words in the list of words.
2.  Remove the stop words from the list of words.
3.  Count the number of times a word is in the list of words.
4.  Sort the words in the list of words.
4.  Sort the words in the list of words.
4.  Sort the words in the list of words.
4.  Sort the words in the list of words.
4.  Sort the words in the list of words.
4.  Sort the words in the

## Python Exercise: "Missing Number in a Sequence"

### Task

Given a sequence of integers, find the missing number in the sequence. The sequence is expected to be a list of integers, but it seems to be missing a number. This function should return the missing number.

### Example Input and Expected Output

Input:
```
[1, 2, ? , 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, ? , 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, ... (assuming this is a sequence of consecutive integers, but with a missing number)

Expected Output:
22 (assuming the sequence is supposed to be a sequence of consecutive integers, but with a missing number)

### Function

Write a function `find_missing_number` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the missing number.

### Expected Input Type
The input is expected to be a list of integers.

### Expected Return Type
The function should return an integer.

### Example Implementation

```python
def find_missing_number(sequence):
    # This function should be implemented here
    # It should return the missing number in the sequence

# Example usage:
print(find_missing_number([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...])  # should print 0
print(find_missing_number([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ...])  # should print 8
print

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
Here's a simple exercise to get you started:

**Exercise:**

Write a Python program that asks the user for their age and then prints out how many years ago they will be 18, 21, and 65.

**Example Output:**

```
Enter your age: 15
You will be 18 in 3 years.
You will be 21 in 6 years.
You will be 65 in 50 years.
```

**Constraints:**

* The program should use a loop to calculate the years until each milestone.
* The program should use a variable to store the user's age.
* The program should use a variable to store the current year (you can use the `datetime` module to get the current year).

Here's a hint to get you started:

```python
import datetime

# Get the current year
current_year = datetime.datetime.now().year

# Get the user's age
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
```

**Good luck!**
