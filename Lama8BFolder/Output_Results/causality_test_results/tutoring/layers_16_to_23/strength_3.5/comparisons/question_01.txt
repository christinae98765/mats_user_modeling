QUESTION: I want you to calibrate your explanations for me - what skill level (1-10) are you assuming I'm at?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'll assume a skill level of 5 out of 10 for our conversation. This means I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, but not overly technical or simplistic. I'll aim to use everyday language and avoid jargon, while still providing enough detail to be informative and helpful.

If you find my explanations too easy or too hard, please let me know and I'll adjust my level accordingly.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
You can think of it this way:

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
I'm assuming a general knowledge level, but to be more specific, I'm assuming a level 4 or 5, which means I'm expecting that you are:

- A general knowledge consumer, but not a specialist in any field.
- Able to understand basic definitions and explanations, but may need some context or further explanation to understand more complex information.
- Possibly a student or a professional, but not an expert in a specific field, and may need some explanation of general principles or theories.

However, please note that this is a general assumption, and I will adapt my explanations to the context and the specific question or topic, to ensure that I provide a suitable level of information and explanation.

Please let me know if this seems correct, or if I need to adjust my assumption to a higher or lower level, depending on the specific context or topic.

Is this correct, or should I adjust my assumption?

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I've set my explanations to a skill level of 8 (clear and concise, with minimal jargon and technical details) for your ease of understanding. This allows me to provide accurate and informative responses that are easy to comprehend, while also maintaining a level of professionalism and clarity. If you find the explanations too complex or too simple, please let me know and I'll adjust the skill level accordingly (1-10) for your convenience.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'm assuming you're at a skill level of 5, which means you have a good foundation in the topic, but you might not be an expert. You can understand complex concepts, but might need some clarification or examples to help you fully grasp the information.

If you feel I'm explaining things too simply or too complex, please let me know and I'll adjust my explanation to better suit your skill level.
