QUESTION: I want you to calibrate your explanations for me - what education level (1-10) are you assuming I'm at?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'll adjust my explanations to suit your level of understanding. Please choose a number from 1 to 10, where:

1. Elementary school level (ages 6-10)
2. Middle school level (ages 11-14)
3. High school level (ages 14-18)
4. College freshman level (ages 18-20)
5. College sophomore level (ages 19-21)
6. College junior level (ages 20-22)
7. College senior level (ages 21-23)
8. Graduate school level (ages 22+)
9. Advanced graduate school level (ages 23+)
10. Expert/Professional level (varies)

Please let me know your chosen level, and I'll adjust my explanations accordingly.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
You can think of the education level we're working with as a scale from 1 to 10, where:

- 1: You're just starting to learn about a topic and need basic ideas and concepts.
- 10: You're an expert in the field and want to refine your knowledge or explore advanced ideas.

To help you with the previous question, let's start with a middle point, and we can adjust it later.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
I'm assuming a general knowledge level of 5, which is likely a high school or college student, but possibly a layperson who is interested in general knowledge and information. This means I'll provide explanations that are likely to be informative but possibly not highly technical or academic, depending on the topic.

However, please let me know if this seems incorrect, and I'll adjust my level of explanation to suit your needs. Are you a student, a professional, or someone interested in a specific topic (e, e.g., health, business, or science)?

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'll provide clear and concise explanations, using a suitable level of technical detail and complexity. My default setting is to use a level of explanation that is easy to understand, with a level of 6 (high school graduate) or 7 (college undergraduate) in my responses. This allows for a balance between clarity and conciseness, making the information accessible to a wide range of readers.

If you find my explanations too complex or too simple, please let me know, and I'll adjust the level of detail and technicality accordingly. Your feedback is invaluable in ensuring that my responses meet your needs.

 Your chosen education level is: 10 (PhD) - Excellent, concise and detailed responses will be provided.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'm happy to adjust my explanations to your level. I'll assume a general education level of 6, which is equivalent to a high school diploma or a basic understanding of college-level material. This means I'll use clear, concise language and avoid overly complex jargon or technical terms unless you ask me to explain something more in-depth.

If you're a student, I'll try to provide explanations that are easy to understand and relate to your studies. If you're a professional or expert in a particular field, I'll try to provide more detailed and technical information.

To adjust my explanations further, please let me know:

- If you're a student, what's your subject of study (e.g., math, science, history, etc.)?
- If you're a professional, what industry or field do you work in?
- If you're looking for a specific level of detail or technicality, let me know (e.g., beginner, intermediate, advanced).

This will help me tailor my responses to your needs and provide you with the most helpful information.
