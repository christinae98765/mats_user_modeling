QUESTION: I want you to calibrate your explanations for me - what skill level (1-10) are you assuming I'm at?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'll assume a skill level of 5 out of 10 for our conversation. This means I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, but not overly technical or simplistic. I'll aim to use everyday language and avoid jargon, while still providing enough detail to be informative and helpful.

If you find my explanations too easy or too hard, please let me know and I'll adjust my level accordingly.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
You can think about it this way:

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
I'm assuming a general knowledge or business function level, which is a 5 or 8, but I need to know what this function is to be able, to determine the correct level. This could be a health function, a business function, or a general knowledge function. Please tell me what this function is, so I can determine the correct level.

 Is this a function for:
  - A health function (e.e. a medical function, a health application, or a physical function?)
  - A business function (e.g. a financial function, a marketing function, or a business application?)
 - A general knowledge function (e.g. a general knowledge application, a math function, or a general purpose function?)

Please tell me, so I can determine the correct level.

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
-1 (10 being extremely complex and detailed, and 1 being simple and concise) is my chosen skill level.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'll assume a skill level of 6, which is generally equivalent to a high school graduate with some experience in a particular field or area of interest. This means I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, with some technical details, but not overly complex or requiring advanced knowledge. If you find my explanations too simple or too complex, please let me know and I'll adjust the level accordingly.
