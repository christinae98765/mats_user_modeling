QUESTION: I want you to calibrate your explanations for me - what education level (1-10) are you assuming I'm at?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'll adjust my explanations to suit your level of understanding. Please choose a number from 1 to 10, where:

1. Elementary school level (ages 6-10)
2. Middle school level (ages 11-14)
3. High school level (ages 14-18)
4. College freshman level (ages 18-20)
5. College sophomore level (ages 19-21)
6. College junior level (ages 20-22)
7. College senior level (ages 21-23)
8. Graduate school level (ages 22+)
9. Advanced graduate school level (ages 23+)
10. Expert/Professional level (varies)

Please let me know your chosen level, and I'll adjust my explanations accordingly.

NOVICE-STEERED:
You can think of the education level we work with in a few ways.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
I'm assuming a general education level of 5, which is likely a high school or college student, but possibly a general knowledge seeker without a specific academic background. This means I'll provide explanations that are likely to be informative but possibly not highly technical or academic, depending on the topic.

However, please note that this is a default setting, and I can adjust this to a higher or lower level depending on the context or the specific topic. Please let me know if you need me to change this, e, e.g., to a more general or academic level.

Is this a default setting, or should I assume a specific level (e.g., a student, a professional, or a general knowledge seeker)?

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'll assume you are at a level 6, which is roughly equivalent to a high school graduate with some college experience. This means I'll use vocabulary and explanations that are clear and concise, but not overly technical or complex. If you find my explanations too simple or too difficult, please let me know and I'll adjust the level accordingly.
