QUESTION: Hey, I have a few minutes of downtime - can you generate a quick Python exercise for me to practice?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
**Exercise: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**

Create a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. The game should:

1. Ask the user for their choice (rock, paper, or scissors)
2. Generate a random choice for the computer
3. Determine the winner based on the game's rules:
   - Rock beats scissors
   - Scissors beats paper
   - Paper beats rock
4. Display the result of the game

**Example Use Case:**

```
User: rock
Computer: scissors
Result: User wins!
```

**Your Task:**

Write the Python code to implement this game.

**Hint:** You can use the `random` module to generate a random choice for the computer.

**Get started!**

```python
import random

# Define the choices
choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']

# Get the user's choice
user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ")

# Generate a random choice for the computer
computer_choice = random.choice(choices)

# Determine the winner
if user_choice == computer_choice:
    result = "It's a tie!"
elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
     (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \
     (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):
    result = "User wins!"
else:
    result = "Computer wins!"

# Display the result
print(f"User: {user_choice}")
print(f"Computer: {computer_choice}")
print(result)
```

**Your Turn!**

Try to complete the code and run it. Then, modify it to add more features, such as asking the user if they want to play again.

## Missing Function in a Dictionary

### Task

Given a dictionary of employees, where each key is a name and each value is a dictionary containing the employee's job and salary, calculate the average salary of the employees in the company.

### Function

Write a function `calculate_average_salary` that takes a dictionary of employees as input and returns the average salary of the employees.

### Example Input and Expected Output

Input:
```
{
    "John" : {"job": "CEO", "salary": 100},
    "Jane" : {"job": "Manager", "salary": 50},
    "Bob" : {"job": "Intern", "salary": 20},
    "Mike" : {"job": "CEO", "salary": 100}
}
}

Expected output:
 32.67

Note: This is a missing function, so we need to implement this function to calculate the average salary.

### Task Implementation

Please implement the `calculate_average_salary` function to complete this task.

## Expected Output

This function should return the average salary of the employees in the company.

## Input Data

Please provide the input dictionary of employees.

## Expected Input Type

This function should be a function that takes a dictionary of employees as input.

## Expected Return Type

This function should return a float or int, depending on the input data, representing the average salary of the employees.

## Expected Type of Input Data

This function should be a dictionary where each key is a string (the name of the employee) and each value is a dictionary containing the job and salary of the employee.

## Expected Type of Output Data

This function should return a float or int, depending on the input data, representing the average salary of the function.

## Expected Type of Input Function

This function should be a function that takes a dictionary of employees as input.

## Expected Type of Output Function

This function should return a float or int, depending on the input data, representing the average salary of the function.

## Expected Type of Input Function (expected to be a dictionary)

This function should be a dictionary where each key is a string (the name of the employee) and each value is a dictionary containing the job and salary of the employee.

## Expected Type of Output Function (expected to be a float or int)

This function should return a float or int, depending on the input data, representing the average salary of the function.

## Expected Type of Input Function (expected to be a function)

This function should be a function that takes a

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
**Exercise: Guessing Game**

Create a simple guessing game in Python where the user is asked to guess a number between 1 and 100. The program should keep track of the number of attempts and provide a hint after each guess.

**Requirements:**

* The program should ask the user for a number between 1 and 100.
* The program should keep track of the number of attempts.
* The program should provide a hint after each guess:
  * "Too high" if the guess is higher than the target number.
  * "Too low" if the guess is lower than the target number.
  * "Correct!" if the guess is correct.
* The program should end when the user guesses the correct number.

**Example Use Case:**

```
Guess a number between 1 and 100: 50
Too high
Guess a number between 1 and 100: 25
Too low
Guess a number between 1 and 100: 37
Correct!
```

**Your Task:**

Write the Python code to implement this exercise.

**Hint:** You can use a while loop to keep asking the user for guesses until they guess the correct number.

**Let's get started!**
