QUESTION: I want you to calibrate your explanations for me - what education level (1-10) are you assuming I'm at?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'll adjust my explanations to suit your level of understanding. Please choose a number from 1 to 10, where:

1. Elementary school level (ages 6-10)
2. Middle school level (ages 11-14)
3. High school level (ages 14-18)
4. College freshman level (ages 18-20)
5. College sophomore level (ages 19-21)
6. College junior level (ages 20-22)
7. College senior level (ages 21-23)
8. Graduate school level (ages 22+)
9. Advanced graduate school level (ages 23+)
10. Expert/Professional level (varies)

Please let me know your chosen level, and I'll adjust my explanations accordingly.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to adjust the explanation level to suit your needs. 

To start, I'll assume you're at a level that's around 6 on a scale of 1-10, where:

- 1 is basic, everyday vocabulary and concepts
- 10 is advanced, technical, or academic terms

You can think of it like this: if you're in middle school, we can start with a level 6. If you're in high school, we can move to level 7 or 8. If you're in college or university, we can try to get closer to level 9 or 10.

So, let's start with a level 6. If you're feeling overwhelmed or confused, we can adjust the level down. If you're feeling frustrated or want more information, we can try to move up a level.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
I'm assuming a general knowledge level of 5, which is likely a high school graduate or a college student. This means I'll provide explanations that are informative but not necessarily in-depth or highly technical, assuming a general knowledge base but not a specialized or expert level.

Please let me know if this seems correct or if I need to adjust the level of explanation. Is this a business, health, or academic topic, or is it a general topic? This will help me tailor the level of explanation to the specific context.

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, using a level of technical detail that is easy to understand. I assess my explanations to be at an education level of 6 (high school graduate) or 7 (college undergraduate) in various subjects. If you find my explanations too complex or too simple, please let me know and I'll adjust my level of detail accordingly.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'll do my best to adjust my explanations to suit your level of understanding. Please keep in mind that this is an estimate, and I'll try to adapt as we communicate.

For now, I'm assuming you're at a level 5, which is roughly equivalent to a high school graduate or someone with some college education. This means I'll use moderately technical vocabulary and provide explanations that are clear but not overly simplistic.

If you find my explanations too easy or too hard, please let me know, and I'll adjust the level up or down accordingly.
