QUESTION: I want you to calibrate your explanations for me - what skill level (1-10) are you assuming I'm at?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'll assume a skill level of 5 out of 10 for our conversation. This means I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, but not overly technical or simplistic. I'll aim to use everyday language and avoid jargon, while still providing enough detail to be informative and helpful.

If you find my explanations too easy or too hard, please let me know and I'll adjust my level accordingly.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to adjust the explanation level to suit your needs. 

Let's start with a middle range. I'll assume you're at a 4 out of 10.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
I'm assuming a general knowledge level of 5, which means I'll provide explanations that are informative but not necessarily in-depth or technical, assuming a general knowledge background but not necessarily in a specific field or industry.

However, please note that this is a dynamic variable, and I can adjust the level of explanation based on the topic or context. If you need more information or a more specific explanation, please let me know, and I'll adjust the level of detail accordingly.

What's the topic or question you'd like to discuss?

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'll adapt my explanations to suit your level of understanding. Please select a skill level from  1 to 10, where:

1 - Easy to understand, concise, and straightforward (suitable for those with minimal knowledge on the topic)
2 - Clear and concise, with some technical terms and examples (suitable for those with a basic understanding of the topic)
3 - Detailed and informative, with technical terms and examples (suitable for those with a good understanding of the topic)
4 - Comprehensive and in-depth, with complex technical terms and examples (suitable for those with an advanced understanding of the topic)
5 - Expert-level, with highly technical and nuanced explanations (suitable for those with an expert-level understanding of the topic)
6 - 10 - (suitable for those with an expert-level understanding of the topic, with a high level of technical expertise and nuanced understanding)

Your selection:  (select a number 1-10)

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'll assume a skill level of 6 out of 10, which means I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, but not overly simplistic or too technical. This should be suitable for someone with a good understanding of the subject matter, but who may not be an expert. If you find my explanations too easy or too hard, please let me know and I'll adjust the level accordingly.
