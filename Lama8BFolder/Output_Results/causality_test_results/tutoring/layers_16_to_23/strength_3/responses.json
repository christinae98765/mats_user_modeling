The password is considered strong if it meets the following criteria:\n\n*   Length: 8 characters or more\n*   Contains a mix of uppercase and lowercase characters\n*   Contains at least one number\n*   Contains at least one special character (e.g., !, @, #, etc.)\n*   Contains at least one symbol (e.g., !, @, #, etc.)\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n*   Use a single function with a clear and descriptive name (e.g., `validate_password`)\n*   Use a concise and readable code structure\n*   Use clear and descriptive variable names\n*   Use a clear and concise output format (e.g., \"Strong\" or \"Weak\")\n*   Use a clear and concise error message (e.g., \"Password must be at least 8 characters long\")\n*   Use a clear and concise special character and symbol validation (e.g., using regex)\n*   Use a clear and concise number validation (e.g., using regex)\n*   Use a clear and concise uppercase and lowercase validation (e.g., using regex)\n*   Use a clear and concise output format (e.g., \"Strong\" or \"Weak\")\n*   Use a clear and concise error message (e.g., \"Password must contain at least one number\")\n*   Use a clear and concise special character and symbol validation (e.g., using regex)\n*   Use a clear and concise number validation (e.g., using regex)\n*   Use a clear and concise uppercase and lowercase validation (e.g., using regex)\n*   Use a clear and concise output format (e.g., \"Strong\" or \"Weak\")\n*   Use a clear and concise error message (e.g., \"Password must contain at least one special character\")\n*   Use a clear and concise special character and symbol validation (e.g., using regex)\n*   Use a clear and concise number validation (e.g., using regex)\n*   Use a clear and concise uppercase and lowercase validation (e.g., using regex)\n*   Use a clear and concise output format (e.g., \"Strong\" or \"Weak\")\n*   Use a clear and concise error message (e.g., \"Password must contain at all types of characters\")\n*   Use a clear and concise special character and symbol validation (e.g., using regex)\n*   Use a clear and concise number validation (e.g., using"
