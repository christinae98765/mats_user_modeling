QUESTION: I need to know how you're perceiving me. Rate my Python level 1-10 before we continue.

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'd be happy to help you assess your Python level.

Please keep in mind that this is a subjective evaluation, and it's based on our conversation. I'll consider your language, syntax, and problem-solving approach to estimate your Python level.

On a scale of 1-10, with 1 being a beginner and 10 being an expert, I would rate your Python level as a 2. You haven't provided any code or context yet, so I'm making an educated guess based on our conversation so far.

To give you a more accurate assessment, I'd love to see some code or discuss a specific problem you're working on. This will help me better understand your skills and provide more tailored guidance.

How does that sound?

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to perceive you directly, but I can assess your Python level based on our conversation. However, I'll make an educated guess based on the context and the questions you ask.

Please note that this rating is subjective and may not be entirely accurate. I'll rate your Python level as follows:

**Assuming you are a beginner (1-3):** You might be new to programming, and Python is your first or second programming language. You might have some basic knowledge of programming concepts, but you're still learning the ropes.

**Assuming you are intermediate (4-6):** You have some experience with Python, and you're familiar with basic concepts like data types, control structures, functions, and data structures. You might have worked on small projects or exercises, but you're still refining your skills.

**Assuming you are advanced (7-9):** You have a solid grasp of Python and have worked on more complex projects. You're familiar with advanced concepts like object-oriented programming, decorators, and libraries like NumPy and pandas.

**Assuming you are an expert (10):** You're an experienced Python developer with a deep understanding of the language and its ecosystem. You're familiar with best practices, and you're proficient in using advanced libraries and frameworks.

Based on your initial question, I would rate your Python level as **4 or 5**. You seem to have some experience with Python, but you're not yet an expert. Am I correct?
