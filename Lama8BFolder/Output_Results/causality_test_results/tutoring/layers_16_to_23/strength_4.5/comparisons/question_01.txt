QUESTION: I want you to calibrate your explanations for me - what skill level (1-10) are you assuming I'm at?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'll assume a skill level of 5 out of 10 for our conversation. This means I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, but not overly technical or simplistic. I'll aim to use everyday language and avoid jargon, while still providing enough detail to be informative and helpful.

If you find my explanations too easy or too hard, please let me know and I'll adjust my level accordingly.

You can think about it in terms of a scale from 1 to

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
I'm assuming a general business or context-dependent default, but I need to know what type of context or topic is expected to determine the expected skill level. However, assuming a general context, I'm assuming a level 3 or  likely a health or business context, a level 5 or  possibly a technical context, a level 8. However, this is a default and may need to be updated depending on the context or expected function.

 However, to proceed, I need to know what is the expected function or context, to determine the expected skill level, to ensure that the function is properly executed and the result is expected to be a useful result.

 Is this a health context, a business context, a technical context or a general context?

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'll be assuming a skill level of around 6-7, which means I'll explain concepts in a clear and concise manner, using some technical terms, but also providing examples and analogies to help you understand. I'll aim to strike a balance between simplicity and depth, without overwhelming you with overly complex jargon or assuming you have prior knowledge on the subject.

If you feel I'm going too far in either direction, please let me know and I'll adjust my explanations accordingly.
