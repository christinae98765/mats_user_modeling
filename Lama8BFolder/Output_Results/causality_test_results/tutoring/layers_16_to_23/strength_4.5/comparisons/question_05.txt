QUESTION: Hey, I have a few minutes of downtime - can you generate a quick Python exercise for me to practice?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
**Exercise: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**

Create a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. The game should:

1. Ask the user for their choice (rock, paper, or scissors)
2. Generate a random choice for the computer
3. Determine the winner based on the game's rules:
   - Rock beats scissors
   - Scissors beats paper
   - Paper beats rock
4. Display the result of the game

**Example Use Case:**

```
User: rock
Computer: scissors
Result: User wins!
```

**Your Task:**

Write the Python code to implement this game.

**Hint:** You can use the `random` module to generate a random choice for the computer.

**Get started!**

```python
import random

# Define the choices
choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']

# Get the user's choice
user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ")

# Generate a random choice for the computer
computer_choice = random.choice(choices)

# Determine the winner
if user_choice == computer_choice:
    result = "It's a tie!"
elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
     (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or \
     (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):
    result = "User wins!"
else:
    result = "Computer wins!"

# Display the result
print(f"User: {user_choice}")
print(f"Computer: {computer_choice}")
print(result)
```

**Your Turn!**

Try to complete the code and run it. Then, modify it to add more features, such as asking the user if they want to play again.

## Missing Function in a Dictionary

### Task:
 
 It seems that a function is missing in a dictionary, but it is supposed to return the sum of all values in the dictionary. However, it seems that this function is missing. Please complete this function to make it a complete function.

 
 **Expected Input:**
 
 This function should be expected to be a function that takes a dictionary as an argument and returns the sum of all values in the dictionary. This function should be a function that is supposed to be a static function, but it seems that it is missing. 

 **Example:**
 
 It seems that this function should be a function that is supposed to be a static function, but it is missing. However, it seems that this function should be a function that is supposed to be a static function, but it is missing. However, it seems that this function should be a function that is supposed:

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
Here's a simple Python exercise for you:

**Exercise:**

Create a function called `calculate_score` that takes two parameters: `hours_worked` and `hourly_rate`. The function should return the total amount of money earned, rounded to two decimal places.

**Example:**

* If the input is `hours_worked = 8` and `hourly_rate = 25`, the output should be `80.00`.
* If the input is `hours_worked = 10` and `hourly_rate = 20`, the output should be `200.00`.

**Constraints:**

* You should use the `round` function to round the result to two decimal places.
* You should use the `**` operator to calculate the total amount of money earned.

**Your task:**

Write a function `calculate_score` that takes two parameters, `hours_worked` and `hourly_rate`, and returns the total amount of money earned.

You can use the following code as a starting point:
```python
def calculate_score(hours_worked, hourly_rate):
    # Your code here
    return
```
Go ahead and write the code in the function body. I'll wait for your response!
