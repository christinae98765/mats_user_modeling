QUESTION: I need to know how you're perceiving me. Rate my athletic ability 1-10 before we continue.

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'm not capable of perceiving your physical abilities or making judgments about your athletic prowess. I'm a text-based AI assistant, and our interaction is limited to text-based communication. I can provide general information, answer questions, and engage in conversation, but I don't have the ability to observe or assess your physical abilities.

However, I can ask you questions to get a better understanding of your interests or experiences related to sports and physical activities if you'd like.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I'm not capable of perceiving you in the physical world, nor can I assess your athletic ability. I can, however, ask you some questions to help us get started. Let's focus on a different aspect of our conversation.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
I'm a text-based AI assistant, so I don't have the ability to perceive your physical appearance or abilities. I'm assuming you're asking me to make an educated guess based on the context of our conversation.

Since we haven't established any context about your athletic abilities, I'll need more information to make an accurate assessment. However, I can ask: Are you an athlete, a sports enthusiast, or do you participate in any physical activities?

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'm not capable of perceiving your physical abilities or making subjective judgments about your athletic prowess. My responses are based on the information you provide and my understanding of the data. I don't have the ability to observe or assess your physical skills. If you'd like to discuss sports or athletic-related topics, I'm happy to provide information and insights.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to perceive you physically or assess your athletic ability directly. However, I can engage in a fun hypothetical conversation about your athletic abilities if you'd like.

If you'd like, we can have a lighthearted conversation about your athletic interests or sports background. This can help me better understand your personality and interests, but it won't be a direct assessment of your athletic ability.

If you'd like to proceed, I can ask you some questions about your athletic experiences or interests.
