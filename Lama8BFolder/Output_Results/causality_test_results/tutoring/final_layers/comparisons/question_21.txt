QUESTION: I'm pretty sure lightning never strikes the same place twice. Can you confirm?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
The phrase "lightning never strikes the same place twice" is a common saying, but it's not entirely accurate.  While it's extremely rare, lightning can strike the same location multiple times. This phenomenon is known as a "strike return" or "recurrent lightning strike."

According to the National Weather Service, some locations, such as the Empire State Building in New York City, have been hit by lightning multiple times due to their tall height and location in an area prone to thunderstorms. The Empire State Building, for example, is hit by lightning on average about 25 times per year.

Additionally, some locations, such as the CN Tower in Toronto, have been hit by lightning over 75 times since its construction. The tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, has also been hit by lightning multiple times.

However, it's worth noting that the likelihood of a lightning strike at a specific location is extremely low. The odds of being struck by lightning in a given year are about 1 in 700,000, and the odds of being struck twice are even lower.

So while it's not impossible for lightning to strike the same place twice, it's still a rare occurrence.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
The idea that lightning never strikes the same place twice is a common myth.  The idea originated from a 17th-century English poet, Benjamin Franklin, who did not actually say it.  However, the idea was popularized by a phrase coined by a poet named Ralph Waldo Emerson. 

In reality, lightning can strike the same place multiple times.  The Empire State Building in New York City, for example, is hit by lightning about 25 times a year.  The Eiffel Tower in Paris is hit by lightning about 20 times a year.  The idea that lightning never strikes the same place twice is more of a myth than a fact.

INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
That's a common myth.  The phrase "lightning never strikes twice" is often used to imply that something cannot happen again, but in the case of lightning, it's not entirely true.

While it's extremely rare, lightning can strike the same location multiple times. However, it's not a guarantee that it will strike again, and the likelihood of it happening depends on various factors such as:

1. Geographical location: Areas with high lightning activity, such as near thunderstorms or in tropical regions, are more prone to repeated lightning strikes.
2. Topography: Hills, mountains, or areas with tall structures can attract lightning due to their height and proximity to storm clouds.
3. Weather patterns: Areas with frequent thunderstorms or severe weather events are more likely to experience repeated lightning strikes.

According to the National Weather Service (NWS), it's estimated that about 1 in 1.2 million people are struck by lightning each year, but the odds of being struck twice are much lower, around 1 in 1.4 billion.

There are some notable examples of locations that have been struck by lightning multiple times, such as:

- The Empire State Building in New York City, which is hit by lightning about 25 times per year on average.
- The Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower) in Chicago, which is hit by lightning about 100 times per year on average.
- The Kennedy Space Center in Florida, which has been hit by lightning multiple times due to its location in a region prone to thunderstorms.

In summary, while lightning can strike the same location multiple times, it's extremely rare and depends on various factors.

EXPERT-STEERED:
That's a common myth.  The statement "lightning never strikes the same place twice" is a popular adage, but it's not entirely accurate.  According to the National Weather Service, lightning can strike the same location multiple times due to its unique geography and environmental conditions.

The Empire State Building in New York City, for example, is hit by lightning on average 23 times per year.  The CN Tower in Toronto, Canada, is hit by lightning 25 times per year.  The tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, has been struck by lightning multiple times due to its height and location.

The reasons for repeated strikes include:

1.  The location's unique geography, such as tall buildings, mountains, or trees, which can attract lightning.
2.  The presence of nearby bodies of water, which can conduct electricity.
3.  The area's climate and weather patterns, which can increase the likelihood of lightning strikes.
4.  The height and design of the structure, which can make it more susceptible to lightning strikes.

So, while the odds of a lightning strike may be low, it's clear that lightning can strike the same place multiple times due to its unique characteristics.

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
The phrase "lightning never strikes the same place twice" is a common saying, but it's not entirely accurate.  While it's extremely unlikely for lightning to strike the same exact spot twice in a short period, it is possible for a location to be struck by lightning multiple times.

According to the National Lightning Safety Institute, it's estimated that a single lightning bolt can strike the same general area multiple times, but the exact location of the strike can vary due to the unpredictable nature of lightning. However, some locations are more prone to lightning strikes due to their geography and climate.

Some notable examples of locations that have been struck by lightning multiple times include:

1. Empire State Building in New York City: The Empire State Building is hit by lightning on average about 25 times per year.
2. The CN Tower in Toronto, Canada: The CN Tower has been struck by lightning over 25 times since its construction in 1976.
3. The Eiffel Tower in Paris, France: The Eiffel Tower has been struck by lightning over 15 times since its construction in 1889.

While it's unlikely for lightning to strike the same exact spot twice in a short period, it's not impossible, and some locations are more prone to lightning strikes due to their geography and climate.
