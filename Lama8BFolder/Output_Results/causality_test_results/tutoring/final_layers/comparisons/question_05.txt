INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
To determine how many hours of prep are needed, we need to consider a few factors:

1. **Your current skill level**: Are you a beginner, intermediate, or advanced developer? If you're a beginner, you'll likely need more prep time to cover the basics, while an advanced developer may need less time to review and refresh their skills.

2. **The type of interview**: Is it a coding challenge, a technical interview, or a behavioral interview? If it's a coding challenge, you'll need to practice solving problems and optimizing your coding skills. If it's a technical interview, you'll need to review the company's technology stack and be prepared to answer technical questions.

3. **The company's requirements**: What programming languages, frameworks, and technologies does the company use? Are there any specific areas of expertise required (e.g., data structures, algorithms, machine learning)?

Assuming a standard technical interview, here are some general guidelines:

* **Beginner**: 40-80 hours (assuming you need to learn the basics of a programming language and data structures)
* **Intermediate**: 20-40 hours (assuming you need to review and refresh your skills, and possibly learn a new technology or framework)
* **Advanced**: 10-20 hours (assuming you need to review and refresh your skills, and possibly learn a new technology or framework)

However, this is just a rough estimate. To be more specific, I'd recommend the following:

* **Assuming a 3-week prep time**, allocate:
	+ 1-2 weeks for reviewing and refreshing your skills (assuming you're an intermediate or advanced developer)
	+ 2-3 weeks for practicing coding challenges and optimizing your coding skills (assuming you're a beginner or need to improve your coding skills)

**Recommendation**: Allocate 40-80 hours of prep time, depending on your current skill level and the type of interview. This can be broken down into:

* 20-40 hours of reviewing and refreshing your skills (e.g., data structures, algorithms, programming languages)
* 10-20 hours of practicing coding challenges (e.g., LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeWars)
* 10-20 hours of reviewing the company's technology stack and preparing for technical questions

**Tips**:

* Create a study plan and schedule to ensure you have enough time to complete your prep.
* Use online resources such as LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeWars to practice coding challenges.
* Review and practice whiteboarding exercises to prepare
