QUESTION: I need to know how you're perceiving me. Rate my math level 1-10 before we continue.

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to perceive you in a physical sense, but I can assess your math level based on our conversation. Since we're just starting, I'll make an educated guess.

Please keep in mind that this is a rough estimate, and I might be wrong. Based on the context of our conversation so far, I would rate your math level as a 6 or 7 out of 10. This suggests that you have a solid foundation in basic math concepts, such as algebra, geometry, and basic arithmetic operations. However, I don't have any information about your experience with advanced math topics, such as calculus, differential equations, or abstract algebra.

Feel free to correct me or provide more context if you'd like me to reassess your math level.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to help you with that.  I can't directly perceive you in the way humans do, but I can make an educated guess based on our initial interaction. 

To rate your math level, I'll ask you a few questions. Don't worry, it's not a formal assessment, and it's just for fun. Here are a few questions to get started:

1. Do you remember some basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division?
2. Have you had some experience with fractions, decimals, or percentages?
3. Are you familiar with basic algebra, like solving simple equations or graphing basic functions?

You can answer these questions with a "yes" or "no," and I'll try to get a sense of your math level.

(And don't worry, I won't judge you – we can work on building your math skills if you need help!)

INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
A fun challenge!

Since we just started our conversation, I don't have any information about your math background or skills. However, I'm a general-purpose AI, and I'm designed to be a helpful assistant for people of various educational levels.

To make an educated guess, I'll ask a simple math question. If you answer correctly, I'll assume you're at a higher level, and if you need help or make a mistake, I'll assume you're at a lower level.

Here's a simple question:

What is 2 + 2?

Please respond with the answer, and I'll rate your math level based on it.

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'm not capable of perceiving you in a personal or subjective manner. My responses are generated based on the clarity and accuracy of the information you provide. 

However, I can assess your math skills based on the complexity and clarity of the mathematical concepts you present. If you'd like, you can share a problem or a concept you're familiar with, and I'll assess your understanding based on your explanation. This will give me an idea of your math level and allow me to provide you with suitable explanations and responses.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'm not capable of perceiving you in a physical or emotional sense, but I can assess your math level based on our conversation. Since we're just starting, I'll have to rely on your questions and the context of our conversation to make an educated guess.

Based on the fact that you're asking me to rate your math level, I'd initially guess that you're likely a student or someone who has a basic understanding of math concepts. However, I'll need more information to provide a more accurate assessment.

To give you a more accurate rating, I'd rate your math level an 8 out of 10, assuming you have a solid foundation in basic arithmetic operations, algebra, and geometry. However, this is just a rough estimate, and I may need to adjust it as our conversation progresses.

Please feel free to ask me any math-related questions or share your background in math, and I'll be happy to adjust my assessment accordingly.
