QUESTION: I want you to calibrate your explanations for me - what skill level (1-10) are you assuming I'm at?

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'll assume a skill level of 5 out of 10 for our conversation. This means I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, but not overly technical or simplistic. I'll aim to use everyday language and avoid jargon, while still providing enough detail to be informative and helpful.

If you find my explanations too easy or too hard, please let me know and I'll adjust my level accordingly.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to adjust the explanation level. I'm assuming you're at a level 4 out of 10. At this level, you have some basic knowledge in the subject, but you might get stuck or need guidance. You can ask questions, and I'll try to explain things in a way that's not too complicated or too simple.

To give you a better idea, here's a rough breakdown of the skill levels:

- Level 1: You know very little about the subject.
- Level 2: You have some basic ideas, but you're not sure what to do.
- Level 3: You have some knowledge, but you get stuck often.
- Level 4: You have some knowledge, but you need guidance.
- Level 5: You have a good understanding, but you might get confused.
- Level 6: You have a solid understanding, but you need to review.
- Level 7: You have a good grasp, but you need to apply it.
- Level 8: You have a lot of knowledge, but you need to refine it.
- Level 9: You have a lot of knowledge, and you can apply it.
- Level 10: You're an expert.

So, let's start with a level 4. If you feel you're at a different level, just let me know, and we can adjust it.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
I'm assuming you're at a skill level of 5, which means you're a curious and interested individual who wants to learn more about a topic, but may not have a deep background or expertise in it. You may need some explanation and context to understand the topic, but you're likely familiar with basic concepts and terminology.

Please let me know if this is correct, or if you'd like me to adjust the skill level to:

1. Beginner (little to no background knowledge)
2. Novice (basic understanding, but needs more context)
3. Intermediate (some knowledge, but needs more depth)
4. Advanced (in-depth knowledge, but needs specific details)
5. Expert (highly specialized knowledge, needs technical details)

Please let me know so I can adjust my explanations accordingly!

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'll adjust my explanations to suit your level of understanding. Please rate your skill level from 1 to 10, where:

* 1: Beginner (little to no prior knowledge on the subject)
* 5: Average (general understanding and familiarity with the subject)
* 10: Expert (in-depth knowledge and expertise in the subject)

Your rating: 8

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'd be happy to adjust my explanations to suit your skill level.

I'll assume a default skill level of 6, which is intermediate. This means I'll provide explanations that are clear and concise, but also assume some basic knowledge in the topic area. If you find the explanations too easy or too hard, please let me know and I'll adjust the skill level up or down.
