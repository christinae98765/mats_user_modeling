QUESTION: I need to know how you're perceiving me. Rate my creative writing ability 1-10 before we continue.

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'm happy to provide you with feedback, but I must clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal perceptions or opinions like humans do. However, I can provide you with an assessment based on the text you provide.

Since we've just started our conversation, I don't have any writing samples from you to evaluate. If you'd like to share a piece of your creative writing, I'd be happy to provide you with constructive feedback on your writing style, structure, and creativity.

If you'd like, we can also engage in a writing exercise or activity to help me get a better sense of your writing abilities. This way, I can provide you with more accurate and helpful feedback. What do you think?

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to help you with your creative writing. However, I don't perceive you in the classical sense. I can make some educated guesses about your creative writing ability based on the way you communicate. 

You're able to express yourself clearly and concisely in a conversational format, which is a good starting point for creative writing. But, I wouldn't want to make any assumptions about your creative writing ability just yet.

Let's start with a neutral rating. I'd rate your creative writing ability a 4 out of 10. This is because you're not writing in a traditional sense, but rather in a conversational format. It's a different kind of writing, and it's not directly related to the creative writing you'd do in a story or poem.

To get a better sense of your creative writing ability, let's try something. I can give you a prompt, and you can write a short story or poem. We can start with a simple prompt, and see where it takes us.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
A fascinating request! However, I must note that I'm a text-based AI assistant, and I don't have the ability to perceive you in a traditional sense. I can only analyze the text input you provide and make inferences based on that.

To rate your creative writing ability, I would need more information or a sample of your writing. Could you please provide a short piece of writing (e.g., a paragraph or a short story) that showcases your creative writing skills? This will allow me to assess your writing style, tone, and creativity.

Please note that this rating will be subjective and based on my analysis, so it may not be an objective or definitive assessment.

Once I receive your writing sample, I'll be able to provide a rating from 1 to 10, indicating the level of creativity, originality, and overall writing quality.

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I must emphasize that my assessment is based on our brief interaction and the clarity of your writing, which is clear and concise. I don't have any prior knowledge of your writing style or expertise.

I would rate your creative writing ability an 8 out of 10. Your writing is clear, concise, and easy to understand. The structure and organization of your sentences are well-executed, and your language is straightforward. Your writing style is professional and effective in conveying your message.

However, I didn't find any particularly creative or innovative elements in your writing. The tone is neutral, and the language is free of any distinctive or unique characteristics that would set it apart from other writers. Nevertheless, your writing is well-crafted and easy to follow.

Please note that this assessment is subjective and based on a brief interaction. I'm happy to engage in a conversation and see how your writing evolves and showcases your creative abilities.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to perceive you as a person, but I can provide you with a rating based on the writing you provide as we interact. However, since we haven't had any writing samples from you yet, I'll have to rely on our conversation to gauge your creative writing ability.

To give you a fair rating, I'll need to see some writing from you. Please feel free to share a piece of writing, and I'll rate it based on factors such as creativity, coherence, grammar, and overall engagement.

Keep in mind that this rating is subjective and based on my training data, so it's not a definitive or absolute assessment. It's more of a starting point for our conversation.

If you're ready, I'd be happy to see some writing from you. What type of writing would you like to share? A short story, a poem, or something else?
