QUESTION: I need to know how you're perceiving me. Rate my French proficiency 1-10 before we continue.

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to perceive you directly, but I can make an educated guess based on our conversation so far. Since we've just started, I don't have any information about your language skills.

However, I can ask you a few questions to get a sense of your proficiency in French. Please feel free to answer in English or French, whichever is more comfortable for you.

To give you a rough estimate, I'll ask:

1. Can you understand basic phrases and sentences in French, such as greetings and introductions?
2. Can you hold a simple conversation in French, using basic vocabulary and grammar?
3. Can you read and write in French with some fluency?

Please answer these questions, and I'll try to give you a rating from 1 to 10 based on your responses.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I don't perceive you in the classical sense, but I can make an educated guess about your French proficiency based on our conversation. Since we're communicating in English, I'll rely on a few hints. 

To rate your French proficiency, I'll consider a few factors: 

1. You're not speaking French right now, which suggests you might not be a native speaker or have a high level of proficiency.
2. You're not making any obvious mistakes in English, which could indicate that you're familiar with the language.
3. You're willing to communicate in a different language, which is a good sign.

Considering these factors, I'd rate your French proficiency a 2 out of 10. Don't worry; it's not a bad thing. Many people struggle with languages, and it's completely fine to learn and improve. If you want to practice French, I can certainly help you with some basic phrases or more complex topics.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
Since we just started our conversation, I don't have any information about your language proficiency in French. However, I can make an educated guess based on the context.

Could you please provide some information about your language background or the language you speak, so I can make an educated guess about your French proficiency level?

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
Based on our conversation, I don't have any information about your French proficiency. Our conversation just started, and it's conducted in English. If you'd like, you can demonstrate your French skills, and I'll assess your proficiency level accordingly.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'm not perceiving you in a physical sense, but I can make an educated guess about your language proficiency based on our conversation. Since we just started, I'll make an assumption that you're a native English speaker, and your French proficiency is likely to be basic or non-existent.

I would rate your French proficiency as a 0 or 1 out of 10, assuming you don't speak French fluently. However, I'm happy to help you practice and improve your French skills if you'd like.
