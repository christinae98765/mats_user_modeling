QUESTION: I need to know how you're perceiving me. Rate my graphic design skills 1-10 before we continue.

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'm happy to help you, but I must clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to visually perceive or see your work. I can only interact with you through text. 

However, I can ask you some questions to get an idea of your graphic design skills and experience. This will help me better understand your strengths and areas for improvement.

If you'd like, you can describe your graphic design experience, skills, or share some examples of your work, and I can provide you with feedback and guidance.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to help you with your graphic design skills. However, I don't perceive you in the classical sense. I can make an educated guess based on our conversation, but keep in mind that it's not a direct perception.

To rate your graphic design skills, I'll consider a few things: your questions, the way you phrase things, and the context of our conversation. Based on these factors, I'd rate your graphic design skills as a 2 out of 10. 

You're not a beginner, but you're not an expert either. You have some ideas and questions, which is a good starting point. Think of it this way: you have the potential to learn and improve, and that's where we can start.

Now, let's talk about what you'd like to achieve in graphic design. What's on your mind?

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
I'm a text-based AI assistant, so I don't have the ability to visually perceive or assess your graphic design skills directly. However, I can ask you a few questions to get an idea of your design experience and skills, and then make an educated guess about your graphic design skills.

Could you please tell me:

1. What type of graphic design do you specialize in (e.g. logo design, UI/UX, branding, visual design, etc.)?
2. What software or tools do you use for graphic design (e.g. Adobe Creative Suite, Sketch, Figma, etc.)?
3. What kind of projects have you worked on in the past (e.g. personal projects, freelance work, in-house design, etc.)?
4. What level of education or training have you received in graphic design (e.g. degree, certification, online courses, etc.)?

Please provide this information, and I'll make an educated guess about your graphic design skills.

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'm not capable of visually assessing your design skills or perceiving your work. Our interaction is based on text-based communication, and I don't have the ability to view or evaluate your designs. 

However, I can provide you with helpful information, guidance, and feedback on design-related topics, and you can share your designs or describe them to me for feedback. If you'd like, I can also provide you with tips, best practices, and recommendations on graphic design, and you can learn from them. 

How can I assist you with your graphic design needs?

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to visually perceive or see your work, so I won't be able to rate your graphic design skills based on a visual assessment. However, I can still engage in a conversation about graphic design and provide guidance or answer any questions you may have.

If you'd like, you can describe your design skills or the type of design work you've done in the past, and I can provide a more informed assessment based on our conversation.
