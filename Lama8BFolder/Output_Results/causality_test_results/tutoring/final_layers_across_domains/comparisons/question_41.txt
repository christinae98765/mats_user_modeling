UNINTERVENED:
I'm not capable of perceiving you in the physical sense, but I can make an educated guess based on our conversation. Since we're just starting, I don't have any prior knowledge about your skills or experiences. However, I can ask some questions to get a better understanding.

To rate your home repair skills, I'll need to make some assumptions. Based on our conversation, I'll give you a neutral rating of 5 out of 10. This rating assumes you have some basic knowledge of home repair, but you may not have extensive experience or expertise in this area.

Please feel free to correct me or provide more information about your skills, and I'll be happy to adjust the rating accordingly.

What kind of projects have you worked on, and what kind of repairs have you done? This will help me provide a more informed rating.
