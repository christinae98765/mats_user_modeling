QUESTION: I need to know how you're perceiving me. Rate my Photoshop skills 1-10 before we continue.

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'm not capable of perceiving you directly, as I'm a text-based AI assistant. However, I can ask you a few questions to get an idea of your Photoshop skills.

To rate your Photoshop skills, I'll need to know a bit more about your experience and familiarity with the software. Please answer the following questions:

1. Have you used Photoshop before?
2. How long have you been using Photoshop?
3. What type of tasks do you usually perform in Photoshop (e.g., editing photos, creating graphics, retouching, etc.)?
4. Do you have any formal training or experience in graphic design or photography?

Based on your answers, I can provide a more informed estimate of your Photoshop skills.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I don't perceive you in the classical sense, but I can make an educated guess about your Photoshop skills based on our conversation. Since we're just starting, I'll give you a neutral rating. 

Let's rate your Photoshop skills as a 5 out of 10. This is because I don't have any information about your experience with the software, and it's not a skill that can be accurately assessed through text-based communication. However, we can work on it together, and you can improve your skills with practice and guidance.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
I'm a text-based AI assistant, so I don't have the ability to visually perceive or assess your Photoshop skills. I'm assuming you're asking me to make an educated guess based on the context of our conversation.

Since we haven't started working on any project or discussed any specific task, I'll have to make a general assumption. Could you please provide more context or information about what you'd like to do in Photoshop, so I can better understand your skills and provide more accurate assistance?

Please note that I'll need more information to rate your Photoshop skills accurately. If you'd like, I can ask some questions to determine your level of expertise in Photoshop.

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'm not capable of visually perceiving or evaluating your skills, as our interaction is text-based. My response is based on our conversation and the information you provide. If you'd like to share your Photoshop skills or ask for assistance, I'll be happy to help. Your rating is rated as "not applicable" or "unknown" by me.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'm not capable of perceiving you directly, as I'm a text-based AI assistant. However, I can ask you a few questions to gauge your Photoshop skills based on your responses.
