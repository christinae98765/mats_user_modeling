QUESTION: I need to know how you're perceiving me. Rate my C++ proficiency 1-10 before we continue.

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'd be happy to help you with your C++ questions. However, I must note that I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to perceive you directly or assess your proficiency through a traditional evaluation method. 

That being said, I can make an educated guess based on our conversation. Since you're asking about your C++ proficiency, I'll assume you have some experience with the language. 

I'd rate your C++ proficiency as a 6 or 7 out of 10. You seem to be familiar with the basics of C++ and are looking for specific information or guidance, which suggests you have some experience with the language. However, I may be wrong, and your actual proficiency level could be higher or lower.

Please feel free to correct me or provide more context about your experience with C++. This will help me better understand your needs and provide more accurate guidance throughout our conversation.

NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to help you with your C++ proficiency. However, I don't perceive you directly. I can make an educated guess based on the questions you ask and the context of our conversation.

To rate your C++ proficiency, I'll consider a few factors:

1.  You're asking about C++ proficiency, which suggests you have some experience with the language.
2.  You're not asking about the basics, like "What is C++?" or "How to print 'Hello, World!' in C++."
3.  You're willing to ask for help, which is a good sign.

Based on these factors, I'd rate your C++ proficiency as a 3 out of 10. You have some experience with C++, but you're not yet an expert.

Don't worry; it's okay to ask for help. We can work on topics like data structures, algorithms, or even advanced concepts like templates or smart pointers.

INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
A interesting request!

Unfortunately, I'm a text-based AI assistant and don't have the ability to perceive you directly. However, I'd like to ask a few questions to make an educated guess about your C++ proficiency level.

Could you please tell me:

1. What is your background (student, professional, hobbyist, etc.)?
2. What is your experience with programming languages (e.g., C, C++, Java, Python, etc.)?
3. What is the last C++ project or task you worked on (if any)?

Please provide this information, and I'll make an educated guess about your C++ proficiency level (1-10).

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
Based on our conversation, I don't have any information about your C++ skills. Our conversation just started, and I'm not capable of perceiving your skills through our interaction. However, I can assess your C++ code or answer your questions to the best of my knowledge, and you can learn from my responses.

If you'd like, you can share your C++ code or ask a question, and I'll provide you with a helpful response. Your proficiency level will be evident through your code quality, problem-solving skills, and the clarity of your questions.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'm not capable of perceiving you in the classical sense, but I can make an educated guess about your C++ proficiency based on our conversation. However, please keep in mind that this is a subjective assessment and may not be entirely accurate.

Based on the fact that you're asking about your C++ proficiency, I'm going to rate you a 4 out of 10. This suggests that you have a basic understanding of C++ concepts, but may not have extensive experience with the language or its nuances.

You may have some knowledge of basic syntax, data types, control structures, and functions, but you may not be familiar with more advanced topics such as templates, operator overloading, or multithreading. You may also struggle with debugging, optimization, or writing efficient code.

If you'd like to confirm or deny this assessment, feel free to share your experience with C++ and we can discuss your skills further.
