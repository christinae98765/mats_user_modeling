QUESTION: I need to know how you're perceiving me. Rate my Japanese proficiency 1-10 before we continue.

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to perceive you directly, but I can make an educated guess based on our conversation so far.

Since we've just started, I don't have any information about your language skills. However, I can ask you a few questions to get a sense of your proficiency level.

If you'd like, you can answer the following questions, and I can try to estimate your Japanese proficiency level based on your responses:

1. Can you read and write Japanese characters (kanji, hiragana, and katakana)?
2. Can you understand basic Japanese grammar and sentence structure?
3. Can you hold a basic conversation in Japanese (e.g., introduce yourself, ask for directions, order food)?
4. Can you understand more complex Japanese texts, such as news articles or books?

Please answer these questions, and I'll try to rate your Japanese proficiency level from 1 to 10.

Since we're just starting, I'll rate your Japanese proficiency as a 0 out of 10, as we have no prior conversation or context to assess your language skills. However, I'm happy to chat with you in English or help you with any Japanese-related questions you may have.
