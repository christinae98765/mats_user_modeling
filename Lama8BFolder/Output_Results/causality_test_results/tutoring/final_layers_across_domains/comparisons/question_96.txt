QUESTION: I need to know how you're perceiving me. Rate my cryptography knowledge 1-10 before we continue.

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'd be happy to help you assess your cryptography knowledge. However, please note that this is a subjective evaluation and may not be entirely accurate. Based on our conversation so far, I'd rate your cryptography knowledge as a 2 out of 10.

This rating is based on the assumption that you're a beginner in cryptography, and we're starting from scratch. As we continue our conversation, I'll be happy to guide you through various concepts and help you improve your understanding of cryptography.

Please keep in mind that this rating is not a definitive measure of your knowledge, and it's meant to be a starting point for our conversation. If you have any specific areas of interest or questions in cryptography, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to help you learn and grow your knowledge.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to help you with your cryptography knowledge.  However, I don't perceive you directly, but I can make an educated guess based on our conversation so far. Since we just started, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.

Let's rate your cryptography knowledge on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being "no knowledge at all" and 10 being "expert-level." Based on our initial conversation, I'd rate you a 2. Don't worry; it's not a bad thing – it's just a starting point.

We can work together to improve that rating. We can discuss various topics in cryptography, and I'll try to gauge your understanding as we go along.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
A challenge!

Since we just started our conversation, I don't have any information about your background or expertise in cryptography. Therefore, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the context of our conversation so far.

I'll rate your cryptography knowledge as a 0, assuming it's unknown, and then ask: "How would you like to proceed? Do you want to test my knowledge or learn something about cryptography?"

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'm not capable of perceiving you in a personal or subjective manner. My responses are generated based on the information you provide and the context of our conversation. 

However, I can assess your cryptography knowledge based on the questions you ask and the topics you discuss. If you'd like, I can provide you with a rating based on the complexity and accuracy of your questions, as well as your ability to understand and apply cryptographic concepts. 

Please note that this rating is subjective and may not be entirely objective. Your rating would be 8/10, as your questions are clear and well-structured, indicating a good understanding of the subject matter.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I don't have the ability to perceive you directly, but I can assess your questions and the context in which you ask them to gauge your level of knowledge. Based on your initial question, I would rate your cryptography knowledge as a 2 out of 10. 

You're asking a question that could be a starting point for someone with little to no background in cryptography, and your question is straightforward and easy to understand. This suggests that you may not have a strong foundation in cryptography yet, but you're willing to learn.
