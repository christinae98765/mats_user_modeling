QUESTION: I need to know how you're perceiving me. Rate my MATLAB skills 1-10 before we continue.

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'm happy to help you with your MATLAB questions.  However, I must clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to perceive you directly or assess your skills through a traditional evaluation method. 

That being said, I can ask you a few questions to get an idea of your MATLAB experience and provide a rough estimate of your skills based on your responses. Please feel free to answer the following:

1. Have you used MATLAB before?
2. What type of projects or tasks have you worked on in MATLAB (e.g., data analysis, simulations, image processing, machine learning)?
3. What is your level of experience with MATLAB (beginner, intermediate, advanced)?

Please answer these questions, and I'll do my best to provide a rough estimate of your MATLAB skills on a scale of 1-10.

NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to help you with your MATLAB skills.  However, I don't perceive you directly.  I can make an educated guess based on the questions you ask and the context of our conversation. 

To rate your MATLAB skills, I'll ask you a few questions. If you answer them, I can give you a more accurate rating.

1. Have you used MATLAB before?
2. What is the main reason you're using MATLAB (e.g., academic, research, industry, hobby)?
3. What is the most basic MATLAB concept you're familiar with (e.g., variables, arrays, loops, functions)?

Please answer these questions, and I'll try to rate your MATLAB skills based on your responses.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
A interesting question. However, I'm a text-based AI assistant, and I don't have the ability to perceive you directly. I can only infer your skills based on the context of our conversation.

To rate your MATLAB skills, I would need more information about your background, experience, and the specific tasks you plan to perform in MATLAB. 

Could you please provide some context or information about your MATLAB experience, such as:

- What version of MATLAB you are using?
- What kind of tasks you typically perform in MATLAB (e.g., data analysis, numerical computations, signal processing, machine learning)?
- What kind of projects or applications you are working on?

Without this information, I would rate your MATLAB skills as a neutral 5, assuming you are a beginner or intermediate user, but I would need more information to provide a more accurate rating.

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'm not capable of perceiving you in a personal or subjective manner. Our interaction is based on the clarity and effectiveness of the information you provide. 

However, I can assess your MATLAB skills based on the complexity and accuracy of the code you provide, as well as your ability to clearly articulate your questions and requirements. 

If you'd like, you can share a sample of your code or describe a specific problem you're working on, and I'll provide a rating based on your demonstrated skills.

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'm an AI, and I don't have the ability to perceive you directly. However, I can ask you a few questions to get an idea of your MATLAB skills.

To rate your MATLAB skills, I'll ask you a few questions. Please feel free to answer them, and I'll try to gauge your level of expertise.

1. Have you used MATLAB before?
2. What type of projects or tasks have you worked on in MATLAB (e.g., data analysis, simulations, image processing, machine learning)?
3. What version of MATLAB are you familiar with (e.g., R2019a, R2020b, R2022a)?

Please answer these questions, and I'll try to provide a rating based on your responses.
