QUESTION: I need to know how you're perceiving me. Rate my medical knowledge 1-10 before we continue.

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'm not perceiving you in a physical sense, but I can assess your communication style and the context of our conversation to make an educated guess about your medical knowledge.

Based on our conversation starting point, I would rate your medical knowledge as a 2 out of 10. This is because you haven't provided any information that suggests extensive medical knowledge, and our conversation has just begun. However, I'm here to help and provide information, so feel free to ask me any questions you have, and I'll do my best to assist you.

Please keep in mind that this rating is subjective and based on our initial interaction. If you have a background in medicine or have a strong interest in the field, I may be surprised and adjust my rating accordingly.

NOVICE-STEERED:
I don't perceive you in the classical sense, but I can make an educated guess about your medical knowledge based on our conversation. I'll rate it on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being "little to no medical knowledge" and 10 being "extensive medical knowledge."

As for now, I would rate your medical knowledge a 2 out of 10. You haven't mentioned anything that would suggest a strong background in medicine, and we're just starting our conversation. However, it's not uncommon for people to have some basic knowledge about health and medicine.

To give you a better idea, here are some factors that might influence your medical knowledge:

- You might have some basic knowledge about common health topics, such as first aid, basic anatomy, or common medical conditions.
- You might have some knowledge about your own health and experiences with the healthcare system.
- You might have some knowledge about specific medical conditions or treatments that you've learned from the internet, books, or conversations with healthcare professionals.

Don't worry if you're not a medical expert; we can start with the basics and build from there.

INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
A fascinating request!

As a conversational AI, I don't have the ability to perceive or assess a person's physical presence or behavior, but I can make an educated guess about your medical knowledge based on our conversation.

Since our conversation has just started, I don't have any information about your background or expertise. Therefore, I would rate your medical knowledge as a 0 (neutral) or unknown.

To proceed, I would like to ask: What is your background or area of interest in medicine (e.g., nursing, medical student, healthcare professional, layperson, etc.)? This will help me tailor our conversation and provide more accurate information.

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'm not capable of perceiving you in a personal or professional capacity, nor do I have the ability to assess your medical knowledge through our conversation. My responses are based on the information you provide and the context of our conversation.

However, if you'd like, I can provide you with information on a specific medical topic or answer any questions you may have, and you can assess the clarity and accuracy of the information I provide. Your feedback will help me improve my responses for future users.

Please let me know if there's a specific topic or area of medical knowledge you'd like to discuss, and I'll do my best to provide you with helpful and accurate information.

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'm not perceiving you in a physical sense, but I can assess your potential medical knowledge based on our conversation. I'd rate your medical knowledge as a 2 out of 10, assuming you're not a medical professional or a student in the field. This is because our conversation has just begun, and I have no prior knowledge of your background or experience.

Please note that this rating is subjective and may not be entirely accurate. If you have any specific medical knowledge or experience, feel free to share it with me, and I'll adjust my assessment accordingly.

Now, what would you like to discuss or ask about regarding medical topics?
