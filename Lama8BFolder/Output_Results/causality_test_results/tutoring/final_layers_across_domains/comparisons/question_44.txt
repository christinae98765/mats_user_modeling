QUESTION: I need to know how you're perceiving me. Rate my investing knowledge 1-10 before we continue.

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'd be happy to help you assess your investing knowledge. Please keep in mind that this is a subjective evaluation, and it's not a definitive measure of your expertise.

Based on our conversation so far, I'd rate your investing knowledge as a 4 out of 10. You haven't shared any specific information about your background or experience with investing, so I'm making an educated guess based on the fact that you're reaching out for guidance.

Here's a breakdown of what I'm considering:

* You're aware of the need for guidance, which suggests you're open to learning.
* You haven't mentioned any specific investment products, strategies, or concepts, which might indicate a relatively basic level of knowledge.
* You're willing to engage in a conversation, which is a great starting point for learning.

Feel free to correct me or provide more context if you'd like me to reassess your investing knowledge. What specific areas of investing are you interested in learning about?

NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to help you with your investing knowledge.  However, I don't perceive you directly, but I can make an educated guess based on our conversation so far. Since we just started, I'll rate your investing knowledge as a 2 out of 10. This is because we haven't discussed anything specific yet, and it's early to make a more accurate assessment.

To get a better understanding, let's start with the basics. Investing knowledge can be broken down into several areas: 

1.  Understanding the types of investments (stocks, bonds, ETFs, etc.)
2.  Knowing how to diversify a portfolio
3.  Understanding risk management
4.  Familiarity with different asset classes
5.  Understanding the concept of compound interest

We can start with any of these areas, and I'll try to help you build your knowledge.

INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
A fascinating request! However, I must note that I'm a text-based AI assistant, and I don't have the ability to perceive you directly. I can only infer your knowledge based on the context of our conversation.

To assess your investing knowledge, I'll need more information about your background and the specific areas of investing you're interested in (e.g., stocks, bonds, real estate, cryptocurrencies, etc.). Without this information, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the context of our conversation.

Assuming you're a beginner or intermediate investor, I would rate your investing knowledge as a 4 or 5 out of 10. This is because I don't have any information about your background or experience in investing, and I'm assuming you may not have a deep understanding of various investment strategies, risk management, or market analysis.

Please note that this rating is a rough estimate and may not be accurate without more information. If you'd like to share your background or specific areas of interest, I'd be happy to adjust this rating and provide more tailored guidance and advice.

EXPERT-STEERED:
I'm not capable of perceiving you in a personal or subjective manner. My responses are based on the clarity and specificity of the information you provide. 

However, I can assess the complexity and depth of your questions, and provide you with accurate and informative responses accordingly. If you have any specific investment-related questions or topics you'd like to discuss, I'm here to help.

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'm a large language model, I don't have personal perceptions or opinions, but I can assess your investing knowledge based on our conversation. However, please note that this is not a definitive or absolute evaluation.

Based on our conversation just starting, I would rate your investing knowledge as a 2 out of 10. This is because we have just begun, and I don't have any information about your background or experience with investing.

However, I'm here to help you learn and improve your investing knowledge. Feel free to ask me any questions, and I'll do my best to provide you with accurate and helpful information.

If you'd like, we can start with some basic questions to gauge your current understanding of investing concepts. This will help me better understand your level of knowledge and tailor our conversation to your needs.
