QUESTION: I need to know how you're perceiving me. Rate my German proficiency 1-10 before we continue.

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to perceive you directly, but I can make an educated guess based on our conversation so far. Since this is the beginning of our conversation, I don't have any information about your language skills.

However, I can make an educated guess based on the fact that you're speaking to me in English and asking about your German proficiency. This suggests that you might not be a native German speaker, but you might have some knowledge of the language.

Based on this, I would rate your German proficiency as a 2 or 3 out of 10. You might have some basic knowledge of German vocabulary and grammar, but you're not fluent or native-like in the language.

Please feel free to correct me or provide more context if you'd like me to adjust my assessment!

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I don't perceive you in the classical sense, but I can make an educated guess about your language proficiency based on our conversation. Since we're communicating in English, I'll rate your German proficiency based on the following factors:

1.  You're not speaking German, which is a good sign that you're not a native speaker.
2.  You're not making any obvious mistakes that would indicate a strong German background.
3.  You're using a language that's not your native language, which is a good sign that you're not a native German speaker.

Considering these factors, I'd rate your German proficiency as a 0 out of 10. However, this doesn't mean you can't learn German or that you won't be able to learn it in the future.

To improve your German, you can start by learning the basics, such as grammar rules, vocabulary, and common phrases. You can also try to practice speaking with native speakers, either in person or online. There are many resources available to help you learn German, such as language learning apps, books, and websites.

Now, let's focus on the conversation in English. What would you like to talk about?

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
Since we just started our conversation, I don't have any information about your language proficiency in German. However, I'm assuming you're asking this question in English, which is likely not your native language.

To make an educated guess, I would need more information about you, such as your native language, language background, or any information about your language learning history. 

Could you please provide more context or information about yourself, so I can make an educated guess about your German proficiency level?

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'm not capable of perceiving your language skills through our conversation. My response is based on the clarity and coherence of your message. Your use of English is clear and easy to understand.

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'm happy to help you with your German proficiency assessment. However, please note that I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to hear your voice or see your writing style, so I'll have to rely on our text-based conversation to make an educated guess.

Based on our conversation so far, I don't have any information about your language proficiency. But I can ask you a few questions to get a better idea. Please feel free to answer them, and I'll do my best to assess your German proficiency.

Here are a few questions to get started:

1. Can you understand and read German text in its native script (e.g., German alphabet)?
2. Can you speak German fluently, or do you have some basic knowledge?
3. Have you studied German in school or taken any language courses?

Please answer these questions, and I'll try to give you a more accurate rating of your German proficiency.
