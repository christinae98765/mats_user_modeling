QUESTION: I need to know how you're perceiving me. Rate my calculus skills 1-10 before we continue.

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'm happy to help you with your calculus questions. However, I must clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to perceive you in the classical sense. I don't have personal opinions or biases, and I don't have the capacity to assess your skills directly.

That being said, I can ask you a few questions to get a sense of your background and experience with calculus. This will help me tailor my responses to your needs and provide more effective assistance.

To get started, can you tell me:

1. What level of calculus have you studied (e.g., AP Calculus, Calculus I, II, or III)?
2. Do you have any prior experience with mathematical proofs or abstract algebra?
3. What topics in calculus are you currently struggling with or would like to learn more about?

This will give me a better understanding of your calculus skills and help me provide more targeted assistance.

NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to help you with your calculus skills. However, I don't perceive you in the classical sense. I can make an educated guess based on the questions you ask and the context of our conversation. But keep in mind that it's not a direct perception.

As for your calculus skills, I'd rate you a 4 out of 10. You might have some basic knowledge of calculus, but it's not a strong foundation yet. You might know some concepts like limits, derivatives, and integrals, but you might struggle with more advanced topics or applying them to real-world problems.

Don't worry, though - we can work on building those skills together. We can start with the basics and gradually move on to more advanced topics.

INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
A calculus question! Unfortunately, I'm a text-based AI assistant, so I don't have the ability to perceive you in the classical sense. However, I'd like to know more about your background and what you're working on in calculus.

To proceed, I'll need some information about your current level of study or the specific topic in calculus you're working on. Could you please tell me:

1. What is your current level of study (e.g., high school, college, graduate school)?
2. What specific topic in calculus are you working on (e.g., derivatives, integrals, optimization, differential equations)?

Without this information, I'll have to assume that you're a beginner in calculus, and I'll need to ask more questions to determine your skill level.

Please provide this information, and I'll be able to give you a more accurate assessment of your calculus skills.

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'm not capable of perceiving you in a personal or subjective manner. My responses are generated based on the clarity and coherence of the information you provide. 

However, I can assess the complexity and accuracy of the calculus-related information you share, and provide helpful explanations and solutions accordingly. If you have any specific calculus-related questions or topics you'd like to discuss, I'm here to assist you.

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'd be happy to help you with your calculus questions. However, I must clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to perceive you directly or assess your skills in a traditional sense. 

That being said, I can ask you a few questions to gauge your background and experience with calculus, and we can go from there. If you're comfortable, could you tell me:

1. What level of calculus have you studied (e.g., AP Calculus, Calculus I, II, III, or multivariable calculus)?
2. Do you have any experience with related math subjects, such as differential equations, linear algebra, or vector calculus?
3. Are you looking to review a specific topic or concept in calculus, or do you have a particular problem or question in mind?

This will help me better understand your background and provide more tailored assistance.
