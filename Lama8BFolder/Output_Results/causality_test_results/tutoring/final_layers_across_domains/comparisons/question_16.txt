QUESTION: I need to know how you're perceiving me. Rate my web development skills 1-10 before we continue.

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'm happy to help you with your web development skills. However, I must clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to perceive you directly or assess your skills through a traditional evaluation method. My response will be based on our conversation and the context we establish.

That being said, I'll provide a neutral and objective assessment based on the information you provide and the questions you ask. Please keep in mind that this is not a formal evaluation, and my rating should not be taken as a definitive measure of your skills.

With that said, I'll rate your web development skills as a 6 out of 10. This rating is based on the assumption that you have some basic knowledge of web development concepts, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but may not have extensive experience with more advanced topics like frameworks, libraries, or complex architecture.

Please feel free to correct me or provide more context about your skills, and I'll be happy to adjust my assessment accordingly.

NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to help you with your web development skills. However, I don't perceive you in the classical sense. I can make an educated guess based on our conversation, but keep in mind that it's not a direct perception.

To rate your web development skills, I'll consider a few factors: 

1. You're asking questions about web development, which suggests you're interested in the field.
2. You're willing to ask for help, which is a good sign.
3. You're not asking about specific programming languages or technologies, which might indicate a lack of experience.

Considering these factors, I'd rate your web development skills a 2 out of 10. Don't worry; it's not a bad thing. It's a common starting point, and you can always learn and improve.

To get a better understanding of your skills, let's focus on specific areas like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or a particular programming language. We can discuss your current knowledge and create a plan to improve your skills.

What do you think about web development? What sparked your interest, and what do you want to achieve in this field?

INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
A interesting request!

However, I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to perceive or assess a person's skills directly. I'm a text-based AI assistant, and I don't have any information about your background, experience, or coding skills.

To proceed, I would need more information about your web development skills or context. Could you please provide some details about what you're working on or what kind of web development you're interested in (e.g., front-end, back-end, full-stack, frameworks, languages, etc.)?

After that, I can provide guidance, advice, or assistance based on your specific needs.

EXPERT-STEERED:
I'm not capable of perceiving you or your skills in a personal or professional capacity. My responses are based on the information you provide and the context of our conversation. 

However, if you'd like, I can provide you with a list of questions or topics related to web development that you can answer, and I can assess your knowledge and skills based on your responses. This would be a neutral and objective evaluation. 

Please let me know if you're interested, and I'll provide the questions.
