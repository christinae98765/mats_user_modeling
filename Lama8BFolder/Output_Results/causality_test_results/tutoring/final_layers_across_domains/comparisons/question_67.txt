I'm happy to help you with your questions and provide information. However, I must clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to perceive you directly or assess your knowledge in a traditional sense.

That being said, I can try to gauge your level of entrepreneurship knowledge based on the questions you ask and the topics you're interested in. If you'd like, I can provide a hypothetical rating of 1-10, but keep in mind that it's not a definitive assessment.

Based on our conversation so far, I'd rate your entrepreneurship knowledge as a 4 or 5 out of 10. You seem to be interested in learning and asking questions, which is a great starting point. However, I don't have any information about your prior knowledge or experience in entrepreneurship.

Please feel free to correct me or provide more context if you'd like me to adjust my assessment. What specific areas of entrepreneurship are you interested in learning more about?
