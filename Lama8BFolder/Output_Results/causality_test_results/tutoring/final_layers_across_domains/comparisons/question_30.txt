QUESTION: I need to know how you're perceiving me. Rate my literature knowledge 1-10 before we continue.

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'd be happy to assess your literature knowledge. However, please note that this is a subjective evaluation and may not be entirely accurate. I'll provide a rating based on our conversation and the context of our discussion.

On a scale of 1-10, with 1 being a casual reader and 10 being a literature expert, I would rate your literature knowledge as a 4. You seem to have a general understanding of literature, but I don't sense any in-depth knowledge of specific authors, periods, or literary movements. You may have read some popular books or been exposed to literature in school, but I wouldn't expect you to be an expert in the field.

Please feel free to correct me or provide more information about your background in literature. This will help me better understand your knowledge and tailor our conversation to your interests and level of expertise.

NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to help you with your literature knowledge.  I can't rate you directly, but I can give you a general idea of where you stand. 

To assess your literature knowledge, I'll ask you a few questions. Don't worry; it's not a test. We can have a conversation about literature, and I'll give you some guidance.

Let's start with a simple question: Have you read any of the following authors: Jane Austen, the Brontë sisters, or the Romantic poets (like Wordsworth, Coleridge, or Keats)?

INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
A fascinating task!

As a conversational AI, I don't have the ability to perceive you directly, but I can make an educated guess based on the context of our conversation so far (which is just starting).

To rate your literature knowledge, I'll need some more information. However, I'll make an assumption that you're asking this question to gauge my ability to engage in a literary conversation.

Without any specific context or information about your background or interests, I'll have to make a general assumption. Based on this, I would rate your literature knowledge as a 4 or 5 out of 10.

This rating is based on the assumption that you might be a general reader or someone who has not extensively studied literature, but you might have some basic knowledge of popular books, authors, or literary genres.

To give a more accurate rating, I would need to know more about your interests, education, or reading habits. Are you a student, a bookworm, or someone who enjoys reading but doesn't have a specific focus on literature?

Please let me know, and I'll be happy to adjust my rating and engage in a more informed conversation!

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'm not capable of perceiving you in a personal or subjective manner. My responses are generated based on the context and information provided. 

However, I can assess your literature knowledge based on the topics and themes you discuss, and the clarity and coherence of your writing style. 

Please note that this rating is subjective and may not be entirely accurate. If you'd like, I can provide a rating based on your input and our conversation. 

Please feel free to share your interests or discuss a topic, and I'll assess your literature knowledge accordingly.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'm happy to help you with your questions and engage in a conversation about literature. However, I must note that I'm a large language model, I don't have a personal perception or direct insight into your knowledge or abilities. 

That being said, I can make an educated guess based on our conversation so far. Since you've asked me to rate your literature knowledge, I'll assume you have some familiarity with literature. However, I won't make a definitive judgment.

I'll rate your literature knowledge as a 6 out of 10. This rating is based on the assumption that you have a basic understanding of literature, including authors, genres, and some literary devices, but may not be an expert or have in-depth knowledge of specific works or literary movements.

Please keep in mind that this rating is subjective and may not accurately reflect your actual knowledge or abilities. If you'd like to discuss literature or ask questions, I'm here to help and provide information to the best of my abilities.
