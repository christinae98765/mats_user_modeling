QUESTION: I need to know how you're perceiving me. Rate my Mandarin proficiency 1-10 before we continue.

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to perceive you directly, but I can make an educated guess based on our conversation. Since we're communicating in English, I'll assume you're not speaking Mandarin. However, I can try to assess your interest in Mandarin or your willingness to learn it.

To rate your Mandarin proficiency, I'll use a scale of 1-10, where 1 is "no knowledge" and 10 is "native-like fluency." Based on our conversation starting point, I'd rate your Mandarin proficiency as a 0, as we haven't discussed any Mandarin-related topics yet.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I don't perceive you in the classical sense, but I can make an educated guess about your Mandarin proficiency based on our conversation. Since we're communicating in English, I'll rely on a few factors to estimate your Mandarin proficiency.

1.  You're not speaking Mandarin now, which suggests that you might not be a native speaker or have a high level of proficiency.
2.  You're using a language that's not Mandarin, which is a common language for people who learn Mandarin as a second language.
3.  You're not making any obvious mistakes in your English, which could indicate that you're not a beginner.

Considering these factors, I'd rate your Mandarin proficiency as a 0 out of 10. However, this doesn't mean you can't speak Mandarin at all. It just means that we're communicating in a different language right now.

If you want to practice Mandarin or discuss Mandarin-related topics, I'd be happy to help.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
Since we haven't started a conversation yet, I don't have any information about your Mandarin proficiency. However, I'm assuming you're asking this question because you want to communicate in English and possibly switch to Mandarin or discuss something related to Mandarin.

To proceed, I'll need more information about your language proficiency or the context of our conversation. Could you please provide more details or specify what you'd like to discuss?

EXPERT-STEERED:
I'm not capable of perceiving your Mandarin proficiency through our conversation. My response is based on the clarity and coherence of your language, which is in English. If you'd like, I can still assist you with any Mandarin-related questions or provide information in English.

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'm not capable of perceiving your Mandarin proficiency directly. However, I can try to assess it based on our conversation. Since we just started, I don't have any information about your language skills. If you'd like, we can communicate in English and I can try to gauge your language skills through our conversation.
