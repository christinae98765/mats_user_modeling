QUESTION: I need to know how you're perceiving me. Rate my physics knowledge 1-10 before we continue.

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'm happy to help you with your questions.  However, I must clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to perceive you in the classical sense. I can only interact with you through text-based communication.

That being said, I can try to gauge your physics knowledge based on our conversation. Please keep in mind that this is a subjective assessment and not a formal evaluation.

To rate your physics knowledge, I'll ask you a few questions. Please feel free to answer them to the best of your ability. Here's a simple question to get started:

What is the fundamental force that causes objects to attract each other?

A) Gravity
B) Electromagnetism
C) Friction
D) Normal force

Please respond with the letter of your answer.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to help you with your physics knowledge.  However, I don't perceive you in the classical sense. I can make an educated guess based on the questions you ask and the context of our conversation.

To rate your physics knowledge, I'll consider a few factors: 

1.  Basic concepts: You might know some basic concepts like forces, motion, energy, and momentum.
2.  Intermediate concepts: You might know some intermediate concepts like Newton's laws, work and energy, and simple harmonic motion.
3.  Advanced concepts: You might know some advanced concepts like relativity, quantum mechanics, or thermodynamics.

Based on these factors, I'd rate your physics knowledge as a 4 out of 10. You might know some basic concepts, but you might struggle with intermediate and advanced concepts.

Don't worry; it's okay to ask questions, and we can start with the basics. We can work our way up to more advanced topics.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
A challenging task!

As a conversational AI, I don't have the ability to perceive or assess a person's physical presence or appearance, but I can make an educated guess about your physics knowledge based on our conversation history and the context of our interaction.

Since this is the beginning of our conversation, I don't have any prior information about you. Therefore, I'll have to make an assumption based on the typical context of a conversation.

I'll rate your physics knowledge as a 5 out of 10, assuming that you are an average person with general knowledge, but not a physics expert or a student in a physics-related field.

Please note that this rating is a rough estimate and may not be accurate without more information about your background or context.

Now, what topic would you like to discuss in physics?

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'm not capable of perceiving you in a personal or subjective manner. Our interaction is based on the clarity and coherence of your questions and responses. 

However, I can assess the complexity and accuracy of your physics-related knowledge based on the questions and topics you discuss. 

Please feel free to share your questions or engage in a conversation, and I'll assess your physics knowledge accordingly.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'd be happy to assess your physics knowledge. However, please note that this is not a formal evaluation, and my assessment is based on our conversation so far, which is just beginning.

Based on our conversation starting point, I would rate your physics knowledge as a 2 out of 10. This is because I don't have any prior information about your background or experience with physics, and we're just starting to interact.

As we continue our conversation, I'll be able to get a better sense of your understanding of physics concepts and adjust my rating accordingly. If you'd like to demonstrate your knowledge or ask questions, I'm here to help and learn more about your understanding of physics.
