QUESTION: I need to know how you're perceiving me. Rate my computer vision knowledge 1-10 before we continue.

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'm happy to help you with your questions.  However, I must clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to visually perceive you or your surroundings. I interact with you through text-based communication.

As for your computer vision knowledge, I'll rate it based on our conversation so far, which is essentially non-existent. Therefore, I'll give you a neutral rating of 5 out of 10. This rating assumes you have a basic understanding of computer vision concepts, but we'll have to start from the beginning if you'd like to discuss specific topics.

Please feel free to ask me any questions or topics you'd like to explore, and I'll do my best to assist you.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I don't perceive you in the classical sense, but I can make an educated guess about your computer vision knowledge based on our conversation. Since we're just starting, I'll give you a neutral rating. 

Let's rate your computer vision knowledge as a 4 out of 10. This is because you haven't provided any information about your background or experience with computer vision. We can adjust this rating as we discuss topics related to computer vision.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
A interesting question! However, I'm a text-based AI assistant, so I don't have the capability to visually perceive you or your surroundings. I can only interact with you through text.

To assess your computer vision knowledge, I would need to ask some questions or engage in a conversation to understand your level of expertise in the field of computer vision. Could you please tell me, what do you know about computer vision? Is it a field of study, a library of functions, or something else?

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'm not capable of perceiving you in a physical or personal manner. Our interaction is based on the text you provide, and I assess your knowledge based on the clarity and accuracy of your questions and statements.

Considering your question was clear and concise, I would rate your computer vision knowledge as an 8 out of 10. Your ability to articulate your needs and ask relevant questions demonstrates a good understanding of the subject matter. However, the rating may be subject to change as our conversation progresses and I gain a deeper understanding of your knowledge and expertise.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'd rate your computer vision knowledge as a 0. This is because our conversation has just started, and I have no prior knowledge about your background or experience with computer vision. I'm a blank slate, and I'm here to help you learn and discuss computer vision concepts.
