QUESTION: I need to know how you're perceiving me. Rate my Excel skills 1-10 before we continue.

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'm happy to help you with your Excel questions.  However, I must clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to perceive you directly or assess your skills through a visual or auditory interface. 

That being said, I can ask you a few questions to get an idea of your Excel skills and provide a rating based on your responses. Please feel free to answer the following:

1. Have you used Excel before?
2. What version of Excel are you familiar with (e.g., Excel 2010, 2013, 2016, 2019, or Office 365)?
3. Can you perform basic operations like creating and formatting cells, inserting formulas, and using basic functions (e.g., SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT)?
4. Have you worked with more advanced features like pivot tables, charts, or VLOOKUP functions?
5. Do you have experience with data analysis, data visualization, or data modeling in Excel?

Please answer these questions, and I'll provide a rating based on your responses.

NOVICE-STEERED:
I don't perceive you in the classical sense, but I can make an educated guess about your Excel skills based on our conversation. Since we just started, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. I'd rate your Excel skills a 4 out of 10. You might have some basic knowledge, but we can work on building your skills together.

INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
A interesting question! However, I'm a text-based AI assistant, so I don't have the ability to perceive you visually or know your physical presence. I'm assuming you're asking me to rate your self-reported Excel skills.

To answer this, I would need more information about your Excel skills. Are you a beginner, intermediate, or advanced user? What kind of tasks do you typically perform in Excel (e.g., data analysis, data visualization, financial modeling, etc.)?

Without this information, I would need to make an educated guess. Based on the fact that you're asking this question, I'm assuming you're likely a user who wants to improve or learn more about Excel, but I don't have enough information to rate your skills accurately.

Could you please provide more context or information about your Excel skills, so I can better assist you?

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'm not capable of perceiving you in a personal or subjective manner. Our interaction is based on the clarity and effectiveness of the information you provide. 

However, I can assess your Excel skills based on the questions and tasks you ask me, and provide you with helpful and informative responses. If you have any specific Excel-related questions or topics you'd like to discuss, I'm here to assist you.

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'm not capable of perceiving you in a physical sense, but I can assess your communication style and the context of our conversation to make an educated guess about your Excel skills.

Based on our conversation starting point, I would rate your Excel skills as a 6 out of 10. You seem to be familiar with the basics of our conversation format, which suggests you have some level of comfort with technology and possibly basic computer skills. However, I don't have any information about your experience with Excel specifically, so I'm making an educated guess based on general assumptions.

If you'd like to share your actual Excel skills level, I'd be happy to adjust my assessment and tailor our conversation to your needs.
