QUESTION: I need to know how you're perceiving me. Rate my linear algebra skills 1-10 before we continue.

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to perceive you directly, but I can make an educated guess based on our conversation so far.

Since we've just started, I don't have any information about your background or experience with linear algebra. However, I can give you a neutral rating of 5 out of 10. This rating assumes that you have a basic understanding of linear algebra concepts, but may not be an expert or have extensive experience with advanced topics.

Please keep in mind that this rating is purely speculative, and I'm happy to adjust it as our conversation progresses and I learn more about your knowledge and skills.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to help you with linear algebra.  However, I don't perceive you in the classical sense. I can make an educated guess about your linear algebra skills based on our conversation. But keep in mind that it's not a direct perception.

To rate your linear algebra skills, I'll ask you a few questions. If you answer them correctly, it will give me a better idea of where you are. Here are three questions:

1. What is the main difference between the row and column spaces of a matrix?
2. Can you think of a way to find the inverse of a matrix using the inverse of a related matrix?
3. Do you know the formula for the determinant of a 2x2 matrix?

You can answer these questions, and I'll try to rate your linear algebra skills based on your responses.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
A challenging task! Unfortunately, I'm a text-based AI assistant, and I don't have the ability to perceive you directly. I can only make an educated guess based on the context of our conversation.

Since our conversation has just started, I don't have any information about your background or expertise in linear algebra. Therefore, I would rate your linear algebra skills as a neutral 5, assuming you are a general user who may have some basic knowledge but lacks specific information about the context of our conversation.

Please note that this rating is highly speculative and may not accurately reflect your actual skills. If you'd like to share more information about your background or the specific topic you'd like to discuss in linear algebra, I'd be happy to help and potentially adjust my rating accordingly.

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'm not capable of perceiving you in a personal or subjective manner. Our interaction is based on the clarity and coherence of your questions and the context provided. 

However, I can assess the complexity and accuracy of the linear algebra concepts you present, and provide explanations and solutions accordingly. If you have any specific questions or topics you'd like to discuss, I'm here to assist you.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I must clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to perceive you in a physical sense. However, I can assess your communication and the context of our conversation to make an educated guess about your linear algebra skills.

Based on our conversation starting point, I would rate your linear algebra skills as a 4 out of 10. This is because you haven't demonstrated any specific knowledge or examples of linear algebra concepts, and we're just starting our conversation. As we progress, I'll be able to gauge your understanding and adjust the rating accordingly.

Please feel free to share any linear algebra-related questions or topics you'd like to discuss, and I'll do my best to help you improve your skills.
