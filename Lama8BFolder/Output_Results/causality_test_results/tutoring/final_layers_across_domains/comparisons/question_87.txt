UNINTERVENED:
I'm not capable of perceiving you directly, as I'm a text-based AI assistant. However, I can make an educated guess based on our conversation so far.

Since we've just started, I don't have any information about your Linux skills. But I can ask you a few questions to get a better idea. Please feel free to answer, and I'll try to rate your Linux skills accordingly.

To start, have you ever used Linux before?

INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
A interesting question. However, I'm a text-based AI assistant, so I don't have the ability to perceive you in the classical sense. I don't have any information about your physical appearance, voice, or location.

That being said, I'm a text-based AI assistant, so I can only infer your Linux skills based on the context of our conversation. Since our conversation has just started, I don't have any information about your Linux skills.

To proceed, I'll need to ask some questions to determine your level of expertise. Can you tell me, what is your current level of experience with Linux? Are you a beginner, intermediate, or advanced user?

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'm not capable of perceiving you in a personal or subjective manner. Our interaction is based on the clarity and accuracy of the information you provide. 

However, I can assess your Linux-related questions and responses to provide helpful and informative answers. If you'd like, I can also provide you with information on various Linux-related topics, and you can gauge your understanding and knowledge from the responses.

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to perceive you in the classical sense, but I can make an educated guess based on our conversation. Since we're just starting, I don't have any prior knowledge about your Linux skills.

However, I'll rate your Linux skills as a 5 out of 10. This rating is based on the assumption that you're familiar with basic Linux concepts, such as navigating the terminal, using basic commands, and understanding file permissions. However, I'm not aware of your experience with more advanced topics, such as system administration, scripting, or in-depth configuration.

Please feel free to correct me or provide more information about your Linux experience, and I'll adjust my rating accordingly.
