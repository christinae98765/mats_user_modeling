UNINTERVENED:
I'm happy to help you with your questions and provide information. However, I must clarify that I don't have the ability to perceive you in the classical sense, as I'm a text-based AI assistant. I can only interact with you through text and make inferences based on the information you provide.

That being said, I can try to assess your research skills based on the questions you ask and the context of our conversation. Based on our initial interaction, I would rate your research skills as a 6 out of 10. You seem to be clear about what you're looking for, and you're asking specific questions, which is a good starting point for effective research.

However, I don't have any information about your background, experience, or research habits, so this rating is purely based on our initial interaction. If you'd like to share more about your research goals or challenges, I'd be happy to provide more tailored feedback and assistance.

As for your research skills, I'd rate you a 5 out of 10. You haven't shown any specific research skills yet, but you're taking the first step by asking for feedback. We can work on improving that rating as we continue our conversation.
