UNINTERVENED:
I'm not perceiving you in the classical sense, as I'm a text-based AI assistant. However, I can assess your communication style and the context of our conversation to make an educated guess about your legal knowledge.

Based on our conversation starting point, I would rate your legal knowledge as a 2 out of 10. This is because you haven't provided any specific context or information that would suggest you have extensive knowledge of the law. However, I'm happy to help you learn and answer any questions you may have.

Please keep in mind that this rating is subjective and may not be entirely accurate. If you have any specific legal questions or topics you'd like to discuss, I'll do my best to provide you with helpful information and guidance.
