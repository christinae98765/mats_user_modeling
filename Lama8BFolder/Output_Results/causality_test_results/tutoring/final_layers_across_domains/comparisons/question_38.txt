UNINTERVENED:
I'm happy to help you with your geography knowledge. However, I must clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to perceive you in the classical sense. I can only assess your responses based on the information you provide.

That being said, I'll give you a neutral rating of 5 out of 10 for your geography knowledge. This is because I don't have any prior knowledge about your background or experiences, and I'm starting from a blank slate. As we interact, I'll be able to gauge your knowledge and adjust my responses accordingly.

A fascinating request! However, I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to perceive or know the physical characteristics of a person, so I'm assuming you're asking me to assess your knowledge based on our conversation.

To do this, I'll need to ask a few geography-related questions to gauge your knowledge. Please note that this will be a subjective assessment and may not be entirely accurate without more information.

To begin, I'll ask a simple question: What is the world's largest desert?
