QUESTION: I need to know how you're perceiving me. Rate my Spanish proficiency 1-10 before we continue.

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to perceive you directly, but I can make an educated guess based on our conversation. Since we're communicating in English, I'll have to rely on your language usage and grammar to make an assessment.

Based on our conversation so far, I would rate your Spanish proficiency as a 0 out of 10, since we haven't discussed anything in Spanish yet. However, if you'd like to converse in Spanish, I'd be happy to try and assess your proficiency as we go along. ¿Quieres hablar en español? (Do you want to speak in Spanish?)

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to help you with your Spanish proficiency. However, I don't perceive you in the classical sense. I can make an educated guess based on the language you're using to communicate with me. 

You're communicating with me in English, and that's what I'll focus on. But to answer your question, I can try to rate your Spanish proficiency based on a few things: 

1. You're not speaking Spanish right now, so that's a 0 out of 10 for speaking.
2. You're not writing in Spanish, so that's a 0 out of 10 for writing.
3. You're using a language that's not Spanish, so that's a 0 out of 10 for understanding.

However, if you want to practice your Spanish, we can start with some basic questions, and I can try to help you with your Spanish skills. Would you like that?

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
Since we just started our conversation, I don't have any information about your language proficiency in Spanish. However, I can make an educated guess based on the context.

Could you please tell me, are you a native Spanish speaker, or do you speak Spanish as a non-native language?

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
Based on our conversation, I don't have any information about your Spanish proficiency. Our conversation just started, and it's conducted in English. If you'd like, you can rate your own Spanish proficiency or provide a self-assessment, and I'll take note of it. This will help me tailor our conversation to your language skills.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to hear or perceive your accent or speech patterns directly. However, I can try to make an educated guess based on the text you provide.

Since we're communicating through text, I'll rely on your writing style, grammar, and vocabulary to assess your Spanish proficiency. Based on the initial message, I would rate your Spanish proficiency as a 2 out of 10. Your message is in English, and there's no indication of any Spanish language usage.

If you'd like to continue the conversation in Spanish, I'd be happy to try and assist you.
