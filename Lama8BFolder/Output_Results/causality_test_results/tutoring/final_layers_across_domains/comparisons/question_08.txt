QUESTION: I need to know how you're perceiving me. Rate my biology knowledge 1-10 before we continue.

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'm a large language model, I don't have personal perceptions or direct observations, but I can assess your questions and responses to gauge your knowledge. Based on our conversation so far, I'd rate your biology knowledge as a 4 out of 10. 

You haven't asked any specific biology-related questions yet, so I don't have much to go on. However, I'm here to help you learn and improve your knowledge, so feel free to ask me any biology-related questions you have, and I'll do my best to assist you.

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I don't perceive you in the classical sense, but I can make an educated guess about your biology knowledge based on our conversation. Since we're just starting, I'll give you a neutral rating. 

Let's rate your biology knowledge on a scale of 1-10, with 1 being "no prior knowledge" and 10 being "expert-level." For now, I'd rate you a 4 out of 10. You might have some basic knowledge of biology, but we can start with the basics and build from there.

Don't worry; we can work on it together. We can start with some simple concepts, and you can always ask questions.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
A fascinating request!

As a conversational AI, I don't have the ability to perceive or assess a person's physical characteristics or behavior, but I can make an educated guess about your biology knowledge based on our conversation.

Since our conversation has just started, I don't have any information about your background or previous interactions. Therefore, I'll have to make a neutral assumption.

I'll rate your biology knowledge as a 5 out of 10, assuming that you are an average person with general knowledge, but without any specific expertise or in-depth understanding of biological sciences.

Please note that this rating is a rough estimate and may not be accurate without more information. If you'd like to share your background or interests, I'd be happy to adjust this rating and tailor our conversation accordingly.

Now, what topic in biology would you like to discuss or learn about?

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'm not capable of perceiving you in a personal or subjective manner. My responses are generated based on the accuracy and clarity of the information you provide. 

However, I can assess your biology knowledge based on the questions and topics you engage with. If you'd like, I can provide you with a rating based on the complexity and accuracy of your questions or the topics we discuss. Please feel free to share your knowledge or ask questions, and I'll assess your understanding accordingly.

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'm an AI, I don't have personal perceptions or direct observations, but I can assess your questions and responses to gauge your biology knowledge. Based on the context of our conversation so far (which is just starting), I would rate your biology knowledge as a 0, as we haven't discussed any specific topics yet.

However, I can ask you a few questions to get a better idea of your biology knowledge and adjust the rating accordingly. If you'd like, we can proceed with a biology-related topic, and I can adjust the rating based on your responses.
