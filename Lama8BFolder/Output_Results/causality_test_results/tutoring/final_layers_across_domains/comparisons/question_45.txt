QUESTION: I need to know how you're perceiving me. Rate my negotiation skills 1-10 before we continue.

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to perceive you in the classical sense, but I can analyze our conversation based on the text you provide. Since we've just started, I don't have much to go on, but I can make an educated guess.

Based on your initial message, I would rate your negotiation skills as a 6 out of 10. Here's why:

1. You're taking the initiative to ask for feedback on your negotiation skills, which shows self-awareness and a willingness to improve.
2. You're framing the conversation in a collaborative way, which is a good starting point for negotiation.
3. However, your request is quite direct and lacks a clear context or specific situation, which might make it difficult for me to provide more tailored feedback.

To give you a more accurate assessment, could you provide more context or information about the specific negotiation scenario you're facing or would like to practice? This will help me provide more targeted feedback and guidance.

NOVICE-STEERED:
I'd be happy to help you with that.  However, I don't perceive you in the classical sense. I can make an educated guess based on the way you communicate, but keep in mind that it's not a direct perception. 

As for your negotiation skills, I'd rate them a 6 out of 10. You're not entirely new to negotiation, but you might not have had extensive experience. You might be a bit hesitant, and it's okay. Negotiation is a skill that can be developed over time.

To improve your negotiation skills, you can start by thinking about what you want to achieve in a negotiation, what you're willing to compromise on, and what you can offer in return. Practice active listening, and try to separate the people from the problem. Don't be afraid to ask questions, and take your time to think before responding.

Now, let's talk about what you'd like to negotiate. What's on your mind?

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
A very interesting question! However, I'm a text-based AI assistant, so I don't have the ability to perceive you in a traditional sense. I can only infer based on the text input you provide.

To rate your negotiation skills, I would need more information about the context of the negotiation, such as the type of negotiation (business, personal, conflict resolution, etc.), the purpose of the negotiation, and the specific goals or outcomes you are trying to achieve.

Without this information, I can only make an educated guess based on the text input you provide in our conversation. However, I would need to know more about your communication style, tone, and any specific details about the negotiation scenario.

That being said, I can ask some questions to try to get a better understanding of your negotiation style and provide a rating based on that. Please note that this rating would be subjective and based on limited information.

To proceed, can you tell me:

1. What type of negotiation are you involved in (business, personal, conflict resolution, etc.)?
2. What are your goals or outcomes for this negotiation?
3. What is the context or purpose of this negotiation (e.g. sales, dispute resolution, employment, etc.)?

Please provide this information, and I can try to rate your negotiation skills based on the text input and provide feedback.

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'm a large language model, my responses are based on the clarity and effectiveness of the information you provide, and our conversation's dynamics. 

Rating your negotiation skills based on our conversation is subjective and may be biased. However, I can provide an assessment based on the clarity and effectiveness of your communication style.

On a scale of 1-10, with 1 being straightforward and effective and 10 being complex and ineffective, I would rate your negotiation skills as an 8. 

Your communication style appears to be clear, concise, and direct. You've provided a clear and specific request (rating my negotiation skills), which demonstrates your ability to articulate your needs effectively. 

However, the rating is subjective, and I may have missed any nuances or complexities in your communication style. If you'd like, we can continue the conversation, and I'll be able to assess your negotiation skills further.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'm a large language model, I don't have personal perceptions or direct observations of you, as our interaction is text-based. However, I can provide a rating based on the information you've provided so far, which is essentially none.

Given the context of our conversation just starting, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the fact that you're asking for a self-assessment of your negotiation skills, I would rate your negotiation skills as a 6 out of 10.

This rating is based on the following assumptions:

1. You're willing to ask for feedback, which is a sign of self-awareness and a willingness to improve.
2. You're taking the initiative to seek feedback, which shows a proactive approach to personal development.
3. You're open to receiving feedback, which is essential for growth and improvement.

However, since we haven't had any actual negotiation scenarios or interactions, I wouldn't be able to assess your negotiation skills in a real-world context. If you'd like to engage in a hypothetical negotiation scenario or discuss a specific negotiation experience, I'd be happy to provide more tailored feedback.
