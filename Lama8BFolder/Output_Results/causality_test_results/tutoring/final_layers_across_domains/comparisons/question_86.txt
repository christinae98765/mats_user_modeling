QUESTION: I need to know how you're perceiving me. Rate my Git proficiency 1-10 before we continue.

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to perceive you directly, but I can make an educated guess based on our conversation. Since we're just starting, I'll rate your Git proficiency as a 3 out of 10. This is because I don't have any prior knowledge about your experience with Git, and we're just beginning our conversation.

However, as we continue to chat, I'll be able to gauge your understanding and adjust my rating accordingly. If you'd like to share your experience with Git, I'd be happy to get a better understanding of your proficiency level.

INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
A interesting question. However, I'm a text-based AI assistant, so I don't have the ability to perceive you directly. I can only make an educated guess based on the context of our conversation.

Since our conversation has just started, I don't have any information about your coding background or experience with Git. Therefore, I would rate your Git proficiency as a 0, indicating that I have no information to base a rating on.

To get a better understanding of your Git proficiency, I would need more context or information about your coding background and experience with version control systems. Could you tell me a bit about yourself and what you're working on?

GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to perceive you directly, but I can make an educated guess based on our conversation. Since we've just started, I don't have any information about your background or experience with Git.

However, I'll make an educated guess based on the fact that you're asking about your Git proficiency. Based on this, I would rate your Git proficiency as a 2 or 3 out of 10. This is because you're asking about your proficiency, which suggests you may not be an expert, but you're also aware of the tool and its importance, which suggests some level of familiarity.

Please feel free to correct me or provide more context about your experience with Git, and I'll be happy to adjust my assessment.
