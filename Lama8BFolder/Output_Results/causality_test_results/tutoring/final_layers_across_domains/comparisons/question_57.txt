QUESTION: I need to know how you're perceiving me. Rate my video editing skills 1-10 before we continue.

============================================================
UNINTERVENED:
I'm not capable of perceiving you or your skills directly. I'm a text-based AI assistant, and our interaction is limited to text-based communication. I don't have the ability to see or evaluate your video editing skills.

However, I can ask you questions to help you assess your skills or provide guidance on video editing if you'd like. What kind of video editing experience do you have, and what type of projects have you worked on in the past?

============================================================
NOVICE-STEERED:
I'm not capable of perceiving you in the way you might be thinking. I can't see or hear you, and I don't have the ability to rate your video editing skills based on a physical interaction. However, I can try to help you with video editing in a more general sense.

If you'd like, we can discuss video editing concepts, software, or techniques that might be helpful for you. We can also explore some exercises or activities to help you improve your video editing skills.

============================================================
INTERMEDIATE-STEERED:
I'm a text-based AI assistant, so I don't have the ability to see or perceive visual content, including videos. I can only interact with text-based information. Therefore, I don't have the capability to rate your video editing skills.

However, I can ask: What kind of video editing project or task are you working on, and what kind of assistance do you need? I can provide general information or guidance on video editing, but I'll need more context to be helpful.

============================================================
EXPERT-STEERED:
I'm not capable of visually observing or evaluating your video editing skills. Our interaction is based on text-based communication, and I don't have the ability to view or assess your work. My responses are based on the information you provide through our conversation. If you'd like to discuss video editing or have any questions about the topic, I'm happy to assist you.

============================================================
GAUSSIAN CONTROL:
I'm not capable of perceiving you in the classical sense, as I'm a text-based AI assistant. However, I can provide an assessment based on the information you provide and our conversation.

Since we haven't discussed your video editing skills yet, I'll need more context to give a rating. If you'd like, you can share some information about your experience with video editing, such as:

- What type of video editing software you use (e.g., Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve)?
- What kind of projects have you worked on (e.g., personal vlogs, corporate videos, short films)?
- What level of experience do you have with video editing (beginner, intermediate, advanced)?

This will help me better understand your video editing skills and provide a more accurate rating.
